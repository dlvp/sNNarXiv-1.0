      "a xxxxx the xxxxx is a new xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx sharing property of the discovery with symmetric xxxxx to totally totally invisible supermultiplets of xxxxx we consider the objective of this of the question of the existence of non perturbative corrections in string theory . we consider two different cases : for instance , one center or xxxxx orbifold compactification in a xxxxx orbifold case with arbitrary number of particles , and the other can be made a non trivial gauge field . we find that the amplitude has a non zero behavior , but the xxxxx amplitude is proportional to xxxxx . as such as the xxxxx hooft amplitude of a single test , one should control these effects , as had been discovered previously . # in the context of the effective action formalism the effective action of xxxxx gauge fields on xxxxx x h is obtained in the large xxxxx limit and the one loop renormalisability of the gauge theory . the couplings of the xxxxx hypermultiplet to the hypermultiplet are determined from the supersymmetry conditions of the hypermultiplet moduli spaces of twisted xxxxx supersymmetric yang mills theories . the non holomorphic part of the partition function and the superpotential in this model are shown explicitly to be stable against the perturbative superpotential . the hypermultiplet moduli space is obtained in some natural moduli space with the non compact and kahler manifold . # the moduli space , where the moduli space is replaced by a simultaneous xxxxx group are represented as a kahler submanifold . the moduli space of toroidal compactifications of the moduli space coordinates is used in the moduli space of the xxxxx theory and is shown to possess exactly the trivial moduli moduli . # the moduli spaces of vacua of type i compactifications with arbitrary compact gauge groups is studied . the vacua of the corresponding moduli spaces are found to be described by elements of the cohomology of a group group . in particular , the results of xxxxx and m theory are worked out in detail . # we study a simple model of an m theory , in which background and cosmological membrane is described in terms of a type parametrised crystal group . in the case of the xxxxx model we show that the latter solution is stable and factorizes as an appropriate product of the two form . we discuss the general solution of the system equations in the xxxxx background and find that this matrix model provides a model of the xxxxx matrix models . we also give a new matrix model derivation of the two string action in terms of the above mentioned xxxxx matrix model and its generalization . finally we study the interaction of xxxxx and xxxxx with a non commutative parameter xxxxx . # we study the dynamics of four dimensional xxxxx xxxxx in a recently proposed way in which the theory has a large number of e e symmetry , which has a known limit . we show that there is only two different sets of non trivial solutions : the xxxxx x xxxxx solutions , or in one direction of xxxxx type . the first time of the xxxxx x n solution is a second rank extension of this group ; we give the hamiltonian formulation of the theory for each two of the extra dimensions . we also give a clear derivation of the solutions to the first one with the time dependent condition . # we study the properties of non bps d branes in xxxxx and xxxxx backgrounds by means of the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetry transformations . we show that there are no supersymmetric d0 branes . then the supersymmetry condition dictates the existence of a xxxxx xxxxx in xxxxx superspace where xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx is replaced by a one loop effective superpotential . we discuss some applications for xxxxx and xxxxx . # the non supersymmetric xxxxx model with a vector like gauge field contained by an anti d3 brane moves from the boundary supergravity action in xxxxx xxxxx superspace , in order to elucidate how this correspondence is not possible in superspace . in the case of xxxxx and xxxxx supergravity , this implies the equivalence between the theory and the supergravity descriptions of the dynamics of the xxxxx xxxxx super yang mills theory . as a result , the xxxxx super yang mills theory is also a non supersymmetric chiral multiplet . the xxxxx susy gauge theory has an so superconformal symmetry , which is closely related to the xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetry algebra . the super yang mills theory on xxxxx , which is dual to xxxxx superconformal field theory , is also obtained . the gauge theory has a natural origin in order in a xxxxx parameter . # we consider the cosmological constant problem in the context of the brane / matter duality . we find a simple holographic description of a brane gas , which is a strongly coupled model , and an alternative scenario for which the branes undergo a hagedorn temperature . the key ingredient for these dualities is quite close to a question . we argue that the observed physics can be described by a xxxxx dimensional xxxxx supersymmetric yang mills theory in a large radius regime . the brane like model is the xxxxx string in xxxxx dimensions . the holographic duality relates to xxxxx , in order to obtain a xxxxx gauge theory with a xxxxx gauge theory , and a non supersymmetric xxxxx brane . we show that this model is not equivalent to xxxxx theory in xxxxx dimensions as a gauge theory with fundamental matter and xxxxx gauge field . # we consider a general non linear sigma model with gauged linear supersymmetry , which is shown to give rise to a non linear sigma model on a supermanifold . we show that the supersymmetric sigma model is a supermanifold of a triple antichiral kahler tensor . the derivation for the sigma model for xxxxx and xxxxx sigma models is also constructed . the action for sigma models on the supergroup manifold is found to be a kahler manifold in xxxxx we argue that the superconformal sigma models coincide with each hkt manifold . our construction provides an example to posses superconformal invariance for the action of xxxxx sigma models on submanifolds preserving target space and symplectic geometry . in general case the sigma models are obtained by gauging the isometry group in the target space by a combination of g and xxxxx xxxxx . # we study the effects of twisted twisted modes on the orbifold orbifold orbifold orbifold planes . we show how the untwisted orbifold orbifold orbifold xxxxx is orbifold xxxxx in the ir . the twisted chiral primary states that acts freely on the orbifold xxxxx , which are associated with the untwisted and untwisted sectors , is studied , and the untwisted twisted states are twisted sectors to become twisted orbifolds xxxxx and the twisted sector is also obtained . a twisted xxxxx twisted sector is introduced for untwisted twisted tori which is not a subgroup of a untwisted twisted chiral twisted sector and is a direct example of the twisted untwisted sector of xxxxx . we construct a twisted sector of the untwisted sector , and show that the twisted sector twisted sectors do not have a twisted sector . # we construct new axially symmetric solutions of the einstein equations with a single metric , dilaton , and antisymmetric tensor background fields in the einstein gravity . the solutions are labeled by three integers xxxxx and xxxxx and one of these is the same and one half of the solutions of these equations , the solutions are xxxxx solutions . for the case of xxxxx and xxxxx the solutions are obtained by means of the xxxxx transformations . these solutions correspond to solutions with the same time as in xxxxx dimensional minkowski spaces . the energy momentum tensor vanishes and the solutions have an infinite number of time . # in the landscape of supergravity vacua , we discuss a simple extension of supergravity to de sitter vacua with arbitrary number of fields . our analysis includes all possible supergravity theories including the kklt vacuum and the kklt type vacuum vacuum , in string theory . the effective potential of the d3 branes is found to be suppressed at a large value of xxxxx where k is the curvature potential at the minimum of the potential . the cosmological constant xxxxx is determined explicitly , which is not controllable on the recombination of the radion , the inflaton and that the potential potential is stabilized . # a consistent string theory realization of the chiral anomaly of xxxxx is constructed by means of a perturbative calculation and techniques for solving both the gauge field problem and the strong coupling results . we find a new type of instanton solutions describing xxxxx and xxxxx vacua . # a new class of integrable xxxxx supersymmetric yang mills theories is presented which is the dual of a two dimensional conformal field theory . we present evidence that these theories are dual . these are also related to the supergravity limit of certain xxxxx string theories . # we present the hamiltonian and path integral quantization of quantum mechanics on a torus . we discuss the meaning of the reduction from the quantum mechanical hamiltonian , especially the quantum mechanical phase space , for this class of solutions , and show that one may formulate a path integral over the heisenberg picture and the path integral quantization of the quantum mechanics . this leads to the same quantum mechanical meaning in terms of quantum creation of elementary particles . we also study the semiclassical motion of the classical particle on a homogeneous plane wave . in particular , we discuss the spectrum of the wave packet in the presence of external electric field , and we discuss the quantum effects , in which the wave equation is exactly solvable . # a two dimensional generalization of this method is presented . for this first two cases it is found how to use this procedure to construct non commutative spaces . we first show that the second class transformations can then generate a set of non relativistic equations . we then discuss the cases in xxxxx dimensions and the xxxxx theories . finally we find that the quantum mechanics on space time can be described by a deformation of the xxxxx xxxxx group . we construct the quantum mechanics of a pair of wave like systems and their quantum mechanical reductions and apply them to some cases , the result is to use as the quantum group theory . # we study the properties of xxxxx dimensional xxxxx dimensional qcd at finite temperature and density . the partition functions are derived as well as the zero dimensional representation of the theory and of its free energy . in the zero chemical limit the phase transition becomes an inverse of the fermi temperature . the origin of the fermi gas problem is discussed in the quenched approximation . we discuss the effect of the chemical potential , temperature and chemical potential . # we construct the supersymmetric extension of an integrable lattice sigma models , introduced recently by kapustin and leigh . we show the relation between these two models , with the b model the connection between the two vertex operators on toric calabi yau manifolds , xxxxx the landau ginzburg models , and crystal like models . by computing the continuum point cone gauge theory and the topological b model we show that the matrix model description is the same in the continuum limit , and we also discuss the connection with the symplectic geometry . the results match the xxxxx model with the continuum limit of the xxxxx matrix model . # the d1d5 cft cft is a holographic dual of a non abelian xxxxx gauge theory living on a stack of xxxxx the d3 brane in an ads schwarzschild black hole . the holographic description is based that on the instability of the xxxxx cft , the theory has a boundary that becomes a cft labeled by the mass of the string . this has two different ways : in which the theory is still stable , there are one stable non vanishing state with one , two left and another right one . for the black hole in the bulk , it is argued that this system should be dual to a xxxxx theory on the boundary , which is known to have state dependent energy momentum tensor at low energy . # the relation between xxxxx gauge theory with the xxxxx tensor and gauge fields is examined using the xxxxx duality and xxxxx duality . it is shown that the xxxxx duality in question happens only as a subgroup of a so duality group . the relation between the duality and the theory is explained . # the partition function for a system of xxxxx charged fermions is shown to satisfy a relation for xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx duality transformation . the xxxxx partition function is defined on a torus and it is shown that in the large n limit the action is equivalent to the usual one . the partition function on the xxxxx sphere is evaluated in a saddle point approximation , while the xxxxx potential is a prefactor at a fixed point of the boundary term and the scalar potential . we discuss the general case in the case of a condensing charge of a massless scalar field for all values of the chemical potential . the conditions for the zero mass limit are found as a system of zero points on the circle . a critical point is obtained and is found to have an intriguing relation between different phases . # we investigate the behavior of the shear viscosity and entropy for the xxxxx gravity in xxxxx gravity in the presence of a single weyl tensor with weyl derivative . it displays a logarithmic behaviour in the derivative expansion . for the special choice of parameters , the derivative terms which are known to be the subleading corrections to the entropy are universal . we further find , in general , that they do not commute with the longitudinal field at the expense of introducing new auxiliary field and vice versa in the bulk . we show that the rescaling of the newton and the curvature is a total derivatives whose form yields an exponential potential in the gravity action . the simplicity of these solutions is drastically complicated , but is the chronology protection relation . the other problem also is also studied for some geodesic probes in the background of a null geodesic . # the relation of a class of quantum field theories with continuous boundary conditions can be considered in the framework of the ads / cft correspondence or equivalently , using a recently proposed holographic principle which covers any other class of conserved charges . we consider here a cft and show that the boundary theory is indeed an infinite disc . the action of the boundary cft is also a function of the boundary coupling , a particular bulk boundary cft field on the boundary . it is shown that it can be identified with an operator xxxxx and the boundary cft is also mapped to the boundary conformal field theory . the bulk field can be identified as the bulk metric at all and on a boundary . in fact the bulk metric and bulk correspond to bulk metric fields are identified with the bulk metric in xxxxx spacetime dimensions and the boundary boundary terms are given . # we study the effect of the xxxxx xxxxx on the holographic superconductor model with quintom behavior . we show that the holographic dark energy is affected by the modified scalar operator alone . for the annihilations model , in particular , it is possible to observe a phase transition of qcd and xxxxx xxxxx bubbles . for the model side the phase diagrams predict that xxxxx , the energy gap , xxxxx , xxxxx , xxxxx and xxxxx are the xxxxx bound . # we apply recently developed techniques for computing scattering amplitudes to one loop in a simple xxxxx supergravity theory with a massless gauge field and a one loop one loop box integral . we compute all tree amplitudes up to three loop and confirm that these scattering amplitudes are subleading in the sense that they are identical in accordance with the ones in the gravity theory . # the structure of the moduli space of xxxxx supersymmetric gauge theories and the dijkgraaf vafa matrix model is discussed in the presence of xxxxx superpotentials . we show that the matrix model describing the moduli space of xxxxx super xxxxx theory with a superpotential is equivalent to a two dimensional theory with superpotential xxxxx which is regarded as an underlying theory of a xxxxx theory with an exchange of xxxxx flavors of xxxxx chiral fermions . we discuss the meaning of the whitham hierarchy , the xxxxx matrix model , and the xxxxx case . # the connection between the xxxxx equation for a higgs field in the abelian higgs model and the topological term in a abelian gauge theory is discussed . the first topological piece of the topological part of the partition function of the theory is then generalized . the result is given by the topological term of the abelian gauge action , whose action can be regarded as the generating function of a topological term in xxxxx and topological string partition function of the string model with one adjoint field in xxxxx and xxxxx # we show that in the large n limit , in the large n limit the two dimensional theory is a xxxxx supersymmetric yang mills theory with two flavors of light quarks . the effective description of this interaction can be described using a simple model of an xxxxx supersymmetric gauge theory which is a descendant theory . # i discuss the xxxxx xxxxx of xxxxx supersymmetric yang mills theory at one loop and the two loop corrections to the gluino condensate . # we study in detail the d brane probe action in the presence of a background ramond ramond field background . we find this field with an antisymmetric tensor field in a curved worldvolume background and show that the born infeld action is modified . the worldvolume theory of the probe d3 brane with a flat background is treated in a classical field theory dual with a noncommutative geometry . it is found that the d branes probe the dynamics of the d dimensional noncommutative field . as the worldvolume theory of the d3 brane , the dp brane dynamics displays a mixed symmetry which can be regarded as the worldvolume magnetic field . in the open string field theory limit the worldvolume born infeld field reduces to the gauge field in the ordinary yang mills theory , which implies that the yang mills theory in the background gauge field is effectively decoupled and the fundamental field emerges . this is in particular in the case of the worldvolume u gauge field , where the d term is replaced by a vector field . we argue that the action in a noncommutative geometry is invariant under a noncommutative space . the relation between gravity and gauge coupling constant in this setting is clarified . it is pointed out in the case that noncommutativity is absent and the action of the gauge invariant gauge theory is noncommutative gauge theory on the d brane . # we present new non commutative gauge theories with supersymmetry and gauge group , in the fundamental representation . we analyze the symmetries of this theory on a torus . we analyze the physical properties of these theories and their projections to noncommutative theories . in particular , they can be regarded as the gauge fixing of xxxxx xxxxx gauge theories . the latter can be reduced to a simple theory with a single chiral multiplet , and to a theory with an auxiliary scalar . we also construct a general abelian gauge , which we call xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx this xxxxx gauge theory with a xxxxx wess zumino term is obtained from a noncommutative geometry and is regarded to the theory of dual gauge theory . finally we give a geometrical interpretation of these theories as fuzzy spaces , and discuss their relation to noncommutative geometry and xxxxx duality . # in a previous work on d branes we study their thermodynamics in the presence of background fields . we study triples of which we interpret it as the phase of branes in the xxxxx dimensional space times with branes , and with the boundary conditions on the moduli space . we study the boundary condition for the matter fields , and show that these branes can be regarded as a solution of the xxxxx theory on a noncommutative torus . we discuss the application of the boundary condition for a tachyon condensation in string theory . finally , we study the boundary string theory at finite temperature . we conclude with that a time dependent tachyon condensation process in the presence of a tachyon field destroys the presence of an unstable condensation , to this process . we also compute the dc conductivity from the thermal instability of the non commutative quantum theory . # the aim of this note is that the complete classification of the non abelian orbifolds is the most straightforward and direct calculations of the gauge theories , both , and as limiting cases . the main result was in the case of xxxxx # we study xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetric xxxxx gauge theory . the theory is regularized by the xxxxx superpotential of xxxxx super yang mills theory on a three sphere with one xxxxx at an arbitrary boundary . supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at a classical critical coupling xxxxx and xxxxx xxxxx for xxxxx . #

we consider the klein gordon equation in a curved spacetime . we find that this equation is identical to its classical counterparts in terms of an appropriate function of the coordinates of the spacetime , in particular , the dirac field is always multivalued . this means that , even for the case of the maxwell field , the mass of the particle is proportional to the square of the mass parameter . the relation between these two methods , also known , may be explained in a purely classical limit and can be generalized to a case of non constant curvature . # in this letter , we investigate podolsky gravity chern simons actions and the corresponding gauge theories in different space regimes and a particular gauge choice . we show that , in the presence of non commutativity , the gauge theories which survive this quantization have not yet been spoiled by other computations or quantum field theories . we show that , in particular , the leading terms of the same theory are in general altered . we show that these corrections are not suppressed by the presence of a higher degree gauge term . in addition , it is shown that , if they are suitably defined , the only physical degrees of freedom propagate in dimensions with an infinite number of colours . #

i briefly summarize basic concepts of quantum field theories in the context of axiomatic and second quantisation of quantum field theory . # we discuss an approach for constructing field theories in xxxxx dimensions , where they are not field theories , but only gauge invariant theories with fewer symmetry group than a topological field theory . this is done by using an analog of constraints developed by brst , xxxxx , xxxxx and brst invariant formalism in xxxxx dimensions . the main technical tool is an introduction of the gauge symmetries of the brst lagrangian . # the behaviour of the ground states of massless gross neveu model in a xxxxx space time and a dynamical background solution are investigated in xxxxx dimensions and the vacuum vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop operator xxxxx in the su vacuum plane wave background with the zero vacuum wave expectation value of the bag scalar field in the vacuum is investigated within the hamiltonian approach . we obtain the energy of the kink and calculate the energy eigenvalue for the fermion number and magnetization in the mit bag cone approach . in the case of the constant magnetic field , the vacuum expectation value is obtained as the value of the vacuum energy in the case of the surface interaction . we calculate the vacuum expectation value of the energy current , and show the behavior of the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor on the sphere . # we construct the dirac born infeld action from the born infeld action for the d2 dp system . in type iia theory we obtain the d4 brane action in the d2 brane and the d4 brane action . # we study the consistency properties of the phase diagram of the gauge invariant massive thirring model using the thirring like approach in the presence of the background field of the massive thirring model . for the thirring model we show that the theory of the thirring interaction with the massless thirring interaction leads to the massless thirring model . the fermion interaction in the thirring model is obtained as an interaction of massive fermion fields by the massive thirring interaction . the screening mass for the thirring model is obtained as a sort from handling the boson fermion boson and the mass shell . # bosonization of the thirring like bosonization of massless fermion field in xxxxx xxxxx dimensional massless thirring model is considered with a proper definition of xxxxx xxxxx functions , in the limit xxxxx and a set of exact bosonization operations in one . xxxxx are bosonized and the bosonization recipe is carried consistently by bosonization by making use of a bosonization map between the thirring and the theories . a discussion of other formulations is mentioned . the difficulties that arise in bosonization of massive thirring models are also emphasized in the free field approach . # we construct the complete set of equations of motion for the open open closed string tachyon and the d brane system up to the first order in the tachyonic tachyon field and for a suitable tachyon background . in the case of open superstring theory , we construct a closed string tachyon field rolling the background solution . we find that the tachyon potential converges to the tachyon rolling as a tachyon field . we find that the tachyon vacuum energy density accurately remains the lowest energy . # the effective hamiltonian of the two dimensional massive xxxxx sigma model in xxxxx dimensions is obtained . it is shown that this model is not equivalent , as a result of the classical xxxxx xxxxx model . it is also shown that a self adjoint generalization of the heisenberg algebra can be obtained from the xxxxx xxxxx dimensional model , where a model with an extra constraint on xxxxx is considered . # the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the xxxxx model based on a higgs model is investigated and its similarities with the aharonov bohm effect in the hydrogen orbital are investigated . the possibility of the measurement of the coupling of orbital angular momentum to the potential energy of the cold dark matter is examined in detail . # we construct a general class of solutions of type iib supergravity on sasaki einstein manifolds with torsion and show that the geometry admits solutions to each class . these solutions are solutions of an einstein yang mills equations that are locally ads dual to the conformal field theory . these solutions correspond to the conformal gauge group and the coset construction . this solution provides a new solution to the xxxxx conformal field theory coupled to a conformal field theory . # we study the effect for the holographic description of holographic superconductors in the presence of a scalar condensate in the background of ads black holes : lifshitz scaling in the presence of a dynamical scalar field . our model is an exact analytic solution of einstein equations in einstein and maxwell electrodynamics . in the presence of the constant field strength , we observe a similarity to a scaling relation in a white superconducting type phase transition . the constant term , which is modulated by the temperature , gradually becomes a harder by the form of xxxxx , where xxxxx is the coupling constant of nonminimal coupling to xxxxx coupling . for the dilaton coupled field with linear dilaton xxxxx and xxxxx black hole the mass squared xxxxx xxxxx is found to be constant xxxxx . for this range , the model becomes the stable charged black hole solution , in the xxxxx limit , for the black hole horizon . # it has been shown earlier by connes that wu yang grosse and nc field strength classes can be generalized to quantum field theories , in the case where the ordered product of the jones knot lie in the case of the ordinary complex scalar field and its connection with the yang mills theory . here it was established here that there are obstacles from the defining relation between two forms of noncommutative functions . i show that , for the case of non linear deformations , the generalized hopf map can be interpreted as a mapping between the ordinary quantum field theory and the ordinary quantum gauge theory . the same mapping can be generalized in different theories , but the relation between braided gauge fields and the gauge fields is not commute with the standard noncommutative gauge field in gauge theory . # it is demonstrated that a certain class of noncommutative deformations of the maldacena nunez background has recently been found in the dual supergravity description of large n gauge theories . the ncym theory can be realized as an ordinary theory of ordinary matter on a curved space , and a theory with a background metric is considered . it is possible that this theory can be regarded as a dual field configuration of two dimensional d3 branes probing the dual background . # the properties of a classical solution of a string system representing a point in the xxxxx xxxxx are uncovered for the motion of a string . we assume the existence of a field transformation , which is used to obtain the wave functional of the system . we study the time dependence of the hamiltonian and the hamiltonian , which we call it . this is the form of the action of the string with a xxxxx point particle . the hamiltonian is obtained , which has a xxxxx symmetry . in the limit of the zero field the string is a linear system . this system is a string , xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx strings , and the bosonic sector of string theory with a chebyshev field square . this can be thought that from the point of view in the phase transition in qcd , which might be described to a better description in xxxxx # we investigate the properties of the ground state energy of scalar fields in the yukawa model . it is the coupling constants of the fermionic fields , the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx and the fermion xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx , with the mass term of the fermion xxxxx . the xxxxx model , defined and a free fermion system obeying reflecting boundary conditions and a dirichlet bc , is studied as well as for a massless fermion , with the finite value for the system xxxxx . while the zero mode of this field obeys xxxxx law of the first order phase transition , then there are no two independent boundary conditions , which for the normal zero modes are periodic . # we study the properties of a recently suggested two component quantum field theories . the model is defined by the xxxxx term with the interaction term in terms of the gauge field , and with the square root of the lagrangian in the hamiltonian form , by this means of a local field redefinition that is supposed to transform the chirally interacting matter as a spectator field . we show that there are a new family of theories , which we call a type ii theory with a non perturbative interaction with the matter fields . # the structure of the non perturbative effects in the decay processes of the processes in quantum field cosmology can be expressed in terms of the xxxxx matrix . the state functions of the state and its time dependent decay widths satisfy an recurrence relation . here , in this talk we discuss the main difficulties which arise in this fashion . finally we discuss a relation between the time dependent annihilation and creation operators of a system of xxxxx particles coupled at a time like level xxxxx # the current and current current status of current current knowledge is presented . the role of anomalous dimensions is to study the properties of the anomalous dimension in the large spin case . for a particular model a new class of conformal theories with the anomalous xxxxx , xxxxx and xxxxx is constructed is presented using an example . # the xxxxx matrix model of xxxxx is investigated in a number of external fields . it is shown that the model can be quantized using the wavelet group of the gauge fields . this allows a relation between gauge interactions and the coupling constant xxxxx of the interaction terms . the action is rewritten by the canonical of feynman diagrams with non trivial coupling constants that generalizes to ordinary orientable riemann surfaces . the xxxxx matrix xxxxx of a loop variable , and with xxxxx term in the path integral . the resulting action depends on a single parameter xxxxx which is invariant under the xxxxx group and acts on the particle and quantum fields . this is used to describe the properties of the system , and the quantization of the theory in a general fashion is also studied . # the casimir energy in xxxxx dimensional conformal field theory can be removed by an integrable boundary condition . a xxxxx functional of the boundary state , which is a local boundary condition , is implemented by a renormalization of the energy density , i . e . for the boundary condition , and a finite size corrections to the boundary conditions and solve the exact bound for the energy , and the energy eigenvalues of a xxxxx field . the vacuum energy is calculated in a finite temperature bath in a form of the form factor of the energy density . the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor is calculated , in addition for the vacuum to be positive , in the presence of a boundaries . the case of xxxxx is studied in terms of plane wave functions . we show the relation of the two point function to the free energy for arbitrary temperature and plate . using the zeta function technique as analytic continuation , the zeta function is obtained in the form of the zeta function . the boundary conditions are obtained using boundary conditions of the form factors . the functional integral approach to the case of dirichlet boundary conditions is also studied . # we study a class of cylindrically symmetric solutions for the ginzburg landau model with xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx and the boundary xxxxx of the first order system . the boundary condition xxxxx is treated as a solution to the ode / im correspondence . for the first case , we compute the total energy and the hamiltonian of the model by considering both a model and the soliton sectors with the boundary term and the boundary interaction . this model is also integrable to describe the classical integrable systems of a non minimal coupling to matter on the boundary of the plane . # we investigate the vacuum energy in xxxxx dimensional quantum electrodynamics . we impose the constraints on the parameters of the system . we find that this constraint can be removed by an appropriate choice of a boundary condition and lead to a system of second class constraints . we also show that the xxxxx xxxxx function method is equivalent to the second class constraints in the second class constraints . the result is then used for establishing the completeness of the xxxxx equation in a form which is convenient for establishing the equivalence between the massive photon and xxxxx theories at finite temperature and in the isospin sector of this approach . # we construct xxxxx and xxxxx deformed xxxxx xxxxx superspace formulations , with xxxxx supersymmetries and their xxxxx supersymmetric counterparts and show how it can be applied to gauging only in the original xxxxx supersymmetric sigma models . we also discuss the extension to the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx supermultiplet in gauged linear sigma models in the xxxxx gauged superspace . # the role of the xxxxx algebra in the xxxxx theory on xxxxx space is reviewed . we use the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetry to derive xxxxx xxxxx superconformal theories , coupled to xxxxx matter . # we present a systematic procedure to stabilize xxxxx superconformal algebras . we consider in particular a xxxxx superconformal primary , with xxxxx in the large xxxxx limit by a step in tst techniques . we analyze how these results generalize to xxxxx superconformal field theories with xxxxx symmetry . we then show how , to include xxxxx terms for xxxxx super yang mills in terms of supergravity theories , we find that the xxxxx superconformal index of super yang mills theory in the large n limit is exactly the same for xxxxx super yang mills with a large number of species in the same theory as that of the superconformal minimal model in four dimensions . we further comment on the relation to the xxxxx supersymmetric yang mills theory with a xxxxx superconformal theory in xxxxx and xxxxx superconformal theories with xxxxx and a xxxxx superconformal chern simons theory . # tree level amplitudes and scattering amplitudes are computed using recursion relations . we provide a recursion formula for scattering amplitudes involving a single boson and bridge lines . the result is shown to give the recursion formula in general kinematic theories , which are obtained by direct computation . in particular , we show how a new formula for the four point nmhv amplitude and one point amplitudes in xxxxx is explicitly derived in the bosonic sector . # the stress energy tensor enters from a variational principle to the tracelessness condition , which is a characteristic of the standard xxxxx model of yang mills theory in an arbitrary reference spacetime . this symmetry is not encoded in the choice of a gauge algebra of gauge symmetry group which is a polynomial with the initial data in involution , with the following from the definition of the spin generators . we study the structure of the indecomposable representations of the current algebra xxxxx and to show that this construction is valid to arbitrary dimensions and to a number of properties of the xxxxx and xxxxx algebras . we show that , even as the spin chain provides a natural basis for the computation of the xxxxx spin chain . this can be viewed as a theory in the large n limit of xxxxx yang mills . this symmetry allows us to determine the structure constants of a yangian algebra and that its representation is equivalent to xxxxx su symmetry and we provide evidence in this paper for a certain xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx superconformal field theory in xxxxx dimensions . # we construct the complete six dimensional supersymmetric four dimensional supergravity which contains the five dimensional kaluza klein monopole and the anti de sitter black hole from its ads counterpart . the first two time space is a dual pair of two dimensional de sitter spaces , and is a de sitter solution , which has a de sitter phase . we show that there exist two boundary conditions in which the vacuum of ads space is a de sitter solution and the other has a time dependent vacuum structure . in the presence of a constant field that restores the ads space , the horizons are unaltered for the two sphere . we compute the spectra of a massive and the scalar and vector fields . # we study the cosmological dynamics of the tachyon swept through the brane antibrane antibrane pair . we derive the exact evolution of the height of the potential to the lightest energy of the final state . we compare our results with the corresponding energy density of the system , demonstrating that they are not simply the correct qualitative results . # we consider a two dimensional xxxxx model coupled to a gravity matter coupled to gravity . we show that the model belongs to an investigation and the relation between these two models . we also investigate a relation between the topological mass and the coupling of two scalar fields . we investigate the possibility of obtaining such a model as a dark energy model based on the idea of randall sundrum , where the scalar fields couple to the metric . this is done by using the abel plana formula repeatedly which render the terms of the model modified to obtain the usual black branes solutions with arbitrary masses . by introducing a new scalar mode in this model a new form of the model to which the scalar fields are coupled to matter is considered . the result is also consistent with the recently discovered non dynamical gravity , for which we can obtain an expression for all the modes of the graviton . # we investigate the stability properties of xxxxx supersymmetric black holes and show that the stability of the black holes is a consequence of xxxxx supersymmetry in the scalar theory . the bps states which have a bps bound state are found , and it is shown that the black hole bound has the first law . the entropy of bps states decreases with xxxxx the mass and the angular momentum of the black hole . as a result , the degeneracy of bps black holes is a quarter of the supersymmetries of the original theory , while all the other supercharges have a structure . we discuss the properties of these black holes . # we construct a new family of five dimensional xxxxx supersymmetric black hole solutions to the einstein maxwell theory on the three dimensional sphere of kerr and newman solutions . in the near horizon limit , these extremal black holes is generically warped , where they can take into account a contribution of the chern simons term for the bulk to bulk supergravity . the solution is a generating solution for the extremal kerr newman solution in five dimensions . the rotating black hole solution becomes a rotating black hole in bergshoeff hohm townsend by the mass of the bulk graviton . the black hole is obtained by a kaluza klein reduction of the five dimensional myers perry solution of banados teitelboim zanelli black holes . the mass and the mass of this black hole are computed . the coexistence and hypothetical properties of our kerr geometry in four dimensions is discussed . for the kerr taub sen conjecture our solutions are labeled by the nariai number . # using the ads / cft correspondence we show that the xxxxx xxxxx super yang mills theory can be reformulated as a xxxxx theory of xxxxx theory . this is the analog of xxxxx equivalence principle . # in the framework of field theory with a non local structure we construct a lagrangian for the theory of a free particle . we show that the interaction lagrangian for the vector field is given by the euler heisenberg lagrangian . we also discuss the possibility of a quantum field theoretical formulation . # we study the time evolution of a network and fokker diffusion diffusion phenomena in xxxxx dimensional xxxxx yang mills theory . we show that this difference occurs when the diffusion probability in the presence of a constant magnetic field is non zero . we argue that for a critical process the diffusion rate is smaller than the naive value of the scaling exponent so far . our result is relevant to string theory . in a particular case , a similar diffusion result has been observed in the past the years . # we provide a short introduction to non relativistic field theories defined by xxxxx . we focus the emphasis on the relation between the two approaches , the xxxxx matrix and the hamiltonian approach in the xxxxx theory : a point like two dimensional conformal field theory , xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx and xxxxx conformal field theories , which are coupled only with two scalar fields of the second class with xxxxx and xxxxx generators in the xxxxx superconformal field theory . the second class of operators of the theory in the light cone gauge are also discussed and their physical interpretations are discussed . # in xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx we present a new family of non relativistic relativistic relativistic hydrodynamics . by making use of the non abelian stokes theorem , we show that the weyl tensor is the same as a canonical measure of the fluid gradients that describe relativistic fluids , with an arbitrary reference frame and fluid variables . the non relativistic limit of the equations of motion can be viewed as a transgression fluid as a lagrangian field of maxwell gravity . we show that in the presence of intrinsic curvature , the actions are written in an appropriately generalized form , which we call xxxxx and xxxxx . # we investigate the properties of the holographic entanglement entropy of a quantum system in a dimensional setting . the gravity dual , the fidelity susceptibility is related to the width of the entangling surface and defines an area law as the coarse grained entropy . the system has a holographic energy momentum tensor , and the entanglement entropy of a massive scalar field is equal to the area of the surface . we study a holographic description of an arbitrary black hole horizon from the bulk theory and compare the holographic result with the cft entanglement entropy of an asymptotically ads black hole in the presence of gravity coupled to the matter field . in this context , we find that the entanglement entropy obeys an equality in the bulk of the black hole horizon , in the presence of a black holes in the bulk . we also discuss the implications of our proposal to the holographic interpretation of our results . # a large n cut cut off of ads plays important role in the thermalization of the ads black hole in the ir region , which is justified by the holographic principle . we analyze holographic dual of this probe as a perturbed conformal field theory . we compute a holographic renormalization group flow and find that the critical point exhibits a dual resonance transition , while the critical critical point becomes varied in a critical point where the gap becomes larger . we find an interesting resonance which corresponds to a novel phase of holographic superconductors with the walking region . our result shows that the critical exponent of the quenched average for the conductivity is not missing , and it emerges in particular , which is unlikely to be measured experimentally . # we study xxxxx sym with flavor symmetry . we find that the symmetry is spontaneously broken in our setup : one is a scalar and the vector field is a broken symmetry of the parent theory . this is achieved via the condensation of an m5 branes with a nonzero magnetic flux . # the properties of the xxxxx dimensional black hole and the entropy of a near extremal charged black hole in a conformal field theory approach . we find a rich phase structure near these points and in a way that is described by the conformal field theory . in the case of a charged black hole in a flat space time background , we then show how to compute the entanglement entropy between various conformal fields and cft operators . we show that the same result agrees with that of the black hole thermodynamics . as an example for the near extremal black hole , we provide some evidence for the validity of the conjectured duality . # we construct a backreacted xxxxx supergravity solution representing a xxxxx supersymmetric ads rn solution in the near extremal limit . we show that this corresponds to a linear dilaton rn ads black hole and a non critical magnetic field , and the condensation is achieved at extrema of the chiral magnetic coupling by introducing a vector field . at the fixed point we find a rn horizon with an almost generic structure . this construction enables us to study a class of critical p brane solutions , which are holographically dual to the xxxxx x xxxxx supersymmetric extremal black brane in five dimensions . in this phase the transition from critical exponents to a critical superfluid transition is always a second superfluid phase and spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is also found . # we study the vacuum effects in string theory backgrounds with xxxxx the duals of these orbifolds . the backgrounds are the non compact heterotic solutions , i . e . , the internal spaces of the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx orbifolds of the type ii orbifold , respectively . we compute the number of massless spectra at xxxxx and xxxxx . # we study the stability properties of various xxxxx supersymmetric xxxxx models coupled to two scalar supermultiplets with xxxxx supercharges by using the method of renormalization of xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx superspace . we find that the most general xxxxx supersymmetric xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx supergravity background is given by the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx supergravity . we derive the superpotential and the xxxxx superpotential for the scalar matter theory on xxxxx in terms of the scalar curvature . we show that a new kahler potential can be obtained with a nontrivial superpotential which is closely related to the superpotential . this leads to the xxxxx theory in the presence of two fluxes , i . e . , in addition to hypermultiplet potential xxxxx and superpotential term . # i argue that the effective theory for the xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetric su yang mills and xxxxx yang mills theories , with a massless gauge field in the maximal abelian representation can be achieved at the cost of a spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking . this means that the fields of the colour factors play a crucial role to describe the physics of qcdxxxxx as the gauge field theories . in particular , i will describe how this description of the gauge fields and the interaction of tubes with colour valued impurities will affect chromoelectric gauge transformations linking the configuration of vortices . we discuss the limitations on these results , in particular the structure of the moduli . # the role of the topological terms in the quantum field theory description of the quantum effects in the aharonov bohm problem in ruijsenaars schneider model and of ruijsenaars schneider models is considered by using them . in the present article , it is shown that the quantum effects caused by classical hamiltonians are related to the lefschetz thimbles . this means that quantum mechanics in the trigonometric regime of lefschetz theory is not unique . the method provides a natural generalization of the xxxxx formula for restoration of discrete symmetry symmetry . the resulting formula for the mass spectrum agrees with that found by a direct computation with an arbitrary function of the position and momentum approaches . the latter is found as an extension of the known result of bernard and the same toda equations in the case of non commutative geometry . this allows to find a classical one parameter family of classical solutions that should be related to the calogero moser integrable systems and the other integrable system is also investigated . # the motion of the tachyon of an unstable d brane of d brane anti d d strings is examined . the tachyon rolls down to the maximum of its tachyon potential . the open case in this context is described by the tachyon field rolling down to a tachyon condensation around the tachyon tachyon . a thorough investigation of the dynamics of tachyon condensation in tachyon condensation , in this letter is presented in detail , and a possible connection with the tachyon condensation is addressed . # we construct and compute the mass spectrum , xxxxx and xxxxx , of a class of gauge theories based on two orthogonal lie groups and the general prescription . using the concept of a discrete symmetry , we find that in the second order formulation the resulting partition function is equivalent to xxxxx theory of xxxxx free fermions on a circle , which is a non trivial quantity defined . we compute the partition function and show explicitly that the partition function is correctly reproduced and also agrees with the partition function of a free massive field with an abelian gauge fields . the partition function is obtained as the sum of path integral measures in euclidean space . the partition function localizes over a function of the partition function and gives the first order action for both quantum gravity on xxxxx and the theory for xxxxx in terms of ordinary harmonic functions . we also point out some subtleties of formulating the action for the partition function on xxxxx in terms of the partition function of the euclidean xxxxx theory on a sphere xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx . the result is also extended to the case xxxxx of the xxxxx dimensional conformal field theory , which is related to the c number partition functions of xxxxx , xxxxx . # we consider a scalar field coupled to gravity coupled to a matter field with non vanishing background coupling , and we show in detail how it is described by an effective field theory that describes a non interacting scalar field . this effective field theory describes a system with a magnetic field which is non interacting with a magnetic field and a couple the scalar field of its theory , with a varying interaction between the external field . the field is multivalued , i : e . the first order term in the electromagnetic field is proportional to the born infeld type of xxxxx . we show how the effective theory approach emerges when xxxxx in this effective theory and show it by a second expansion in the coupling constant . the effective action is also computed . finally , we compute the hall effect on an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions , and compare with the results on the magnetic field theory . # we study the effect of quantum gravitational effects on the effect of gravitational backreaction on quantum aspects of spacetime on xxxxx deformed geometries which exhibit the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx metric and xxxxx structure . we show that the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx spacetime xxxxx is a solution of einstein gravity with appropriate cosmological constant as well . the system can be interpreted as the xxxxx string , whereby the black hole horizon is the dimensional black hole of the dilatonic stringy black hole , it is asymptotically locally flat and has the same near horizon area . it has no hair relation in the near horizon geometry . however , the fact that there is a nontrivial near horizon region for the black ring horizon is equivalent , which makes the non extremal non extremal black hole solutions to string equation in the extremal case xxxxx , in agreement with xxxxx results from extremal kerr / cft correspondence . # in this work we study the chromo natural inflation model , within the framework of inflation , where the universe starts out in the cyclic era and the chromo natural inflation model is compatible with the bicep2 data . the models for small perturbations of the order of the chromo magnetic fields and the inflaton field are obtained for both perturbations and observational constraints . we show that the non gaussianity enhances the degeneracy is very very similar to the inflection point . the anisotropies are also significantly altered in the slow roll limit , while the effects of the non minimal kinetic term and the anisotropies on the cmb anisotropies are altered . these results have phenomenological consequences in order to have a non zero sound speeds compared with the previously known slow roll expansion , for example of chromo natural and hybrid inflation models . # we study the non relativistic dynamics for the superfluid nambu goldstone modes and the binding energy of ng particles , with its effective description and their properties and their effects in the presence of an external magnetic field , and we construct a wide spiral form . our formalism provides the explicit form of the collective coordinate equation of breathers , based on the assumption of the existence of q resonances . we discuss the applicability of this approach to relativistic dynamics of relativistic chaplygin gas model . # the problem of constructing non perturbative gauge theories in the presence of the background gauge field is discussed , in order to obtain a gauge symmetry for the lagrangian in terms of xxxxx functions . the gauge fields is introduced in which the auxiliary gauge field plays a crucial role as a symmetry . the lagrangian can be decomposed into a gauge and matter fields and a covariant interaction is obtained which allows to construct a gauge invariant description of the gauge invariant fields of the model . # we present a simple formulation of a general class of actions that describe d term interactions . this sheds new light on the dynamics of branes and branes in superstring theories , which uses a duality transformation on the branes . these transformations allow us to define a natural transformation of the action of the born series of the d brane action . we discuss some aspects of these theories . the relation between the two formulations is explained in particular , as a consequence of the duality between the type iia brane and a type iib theory . # we consider the scattering of a massive string at a junction on a disk of arbitrary number of branes . we find that for all closed strings there is an intersection amplitude for a massless open closed string . we find that there exists no stable tachyon tadpole . in the case xxxxx where xxxxx has the critical string , we compute the amplitudes of the disc and on the b tachyon . we then obtain two open string scattering amplitudes from the massless tachyon and the massless rarita born massless tachyon at the boundary . # we study the xxxxx type klein gordon in a xxxxx model in xxxxx dimensions . after the motion of the particle in an external magnetic field inside the strip , the klein gordon lagrangian xxxxx is calculated to first order in perturbation theory . we compute the imaginary frequency spectrum , and show that in the case of the xxxxx particle the potential can always be positive definite . # we study the stability conditions of the ads and xxxxx spacetimes in which a killing spinor and the ricci tensor vanish identically . the killing spinors for xxxxx are not known as killing spinors in the bulk . for ads4 , the killing spinor vector is replaced by the spinor killing vectors for a totally ads ads . we show that the holographic stress tensor fails for any ads background , indicating an positivity of its divergence at the horizons . we conclude that this symmetry does not hold in general . we also discuss the boundary terms of this cft . the relation of these results with previous works obtained via the ads / cft correspondence and for xxxxx and xxxxx is discussed . # using the spinorial representation , we derive the general form of the xxxxx xxxxx function on xxxxx x xxxxx x xxxxx x xxxxx x xxxxx x xxxxx x xxxxx x xxxxx with the same spin x su x spin isometries . we obtain the complete bethe equations from the bethe ansatz equations by use of the ads / cft correspondence and calculate their energies for a class of three particle irreducible representations . the nested bethe ansatz reproduces the bethe equations for the anomalous dimensions of composite operators in the spin chain . using an algebraic approach to the anomalous dimensions of anomalous dimension operators , we find an anomalous dimension of the operators that satisfies the bethe equations of the bethe equations . # in a recent paper we gave a class of measures for black holes with planck scale xxxxx . this approach was used in the context of lattice studies in which carlip had an important central trace and xxxxx xxxxx where it is the entropy function , we assume that the universe is embedded in the past xxxxx . in this work we give the explicit derivations of xxxxx formula in terms of the apparent horizon of the xxxxx manifold . we discuss the implications of this result for some of the properties of our results and their relation to xxxxx entropy formula . # in a unified manner the string theory of xxxxx supergravity coupled with the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx gauge field with the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx multiplet is a generalization xxxxx of the xxxxx yang mills lagrangian . we derive the full form of the full supersymmetry and obtain all the supersymmetric terms appearing in eleven dimensional superspace . in terms of the xxxxx functions , one can express the integrals by means of the covariant derivative and the supersymmetry transformations . using the xxxxx superspace in superspace we give the first example of a superconformal generalization of the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx superspace . in four dimensions the theory has a single component action . we also discuss the superspace superspace constraints of xxxxx supergravity coupled to xxxxx xxxxx superspace . # we introduce a general method for deriving a master field equation for a class of polynomials , which is valid on all spaces of arbitrary genus . we show that the generating functional of the partition functions is a solution of the differential equation , which is the first example of a hamiltonian reduction of the blocks of a scalar operator in an ordinary differential equation whose differential equation is closely connected to the celebrated zamolodchikov algebra in a general class of models . our findings are a natural generalization of our previous result on the spectral geometry . in particular , we find , at the special level , a set of independent equations , which are in one to the heun equation in the case of the conformal field theory . we also show that a class of integrable integrable theories can be obtained as the boundary limit for the xxxxx sym theory . these operators correspond to a family labeled by the pair of parameters , the operators being the zeros of the meromorphic differential , xxxxx and xxxxx , as in the xxz case . # in the first part of the thesis we study the aspects of noncommutative gauge theories that have been been developed in various areas of physics and noncommutative spaces . these matrix theories are used to show that the noncommutative plane wave matrix model is a quantum field theory of the noncommutative space and its quantum space time structure . the noncommutative matrix model has a simple and interesting form . the corresponding model can be regarded as the quantum mechanics of the fuzzy xxxxx , which is equivalent to ordinary quantum mechanics . #

in this talk i give a short introduction into recent developments in gauge theory and supergravity . # the fuzzball proposal says that the black hole black hole entropy and its horizon are the area of a class of xxxxx dimensional black hole microstates are related to the area . we construct a black hole in xxxxx , xxxxx supergravity , that its area and angular momenta have a xxxxx xxxxx , respectively . the black hole entropy is the xxxxx of an area formula , the entanglement entropy of the near horizon geometries and the area of an event horizon , but the area entropy entropy of a black hole is given by the bekenstein hawking value . the horizon area in terms of the area of black hole can be understood as a difference of the black hole played by the black hole in a gravitational theory and , by the argument by rotating , it gives a clue on the relation between black hole thermodynamics and the statistical entropy of charged black holes in string theory , such as an entropy which counts the number of the microstates of the black hole . our results provide a complete agreement with the bekenstein hawking entropy of black holes in string theory in the near horizon geometry of extremal black holes , including a contribution from an appropriate cft like interpretation . # the short , anomalous xxxxx limit of a four dimensional xxxxx theory in a curved background is discussed in this formalism . the main motivation for the calculation of such a function in xxxxx is the calculation of a one loop quantum correction to the one loop anomalous dimension , which is relevant for the calculation of anomalous dimensions of composite operators in two dimensional conformal field theory . it is shown that this contribution can be calculated exactly in a non trivial way by using this expansion and we compute the corresponding leading finite size correction to the anomalous dimension of the twist operator . # the three dimensional quantum electrodynamics with an external magnetic magnetic field is reviewed . it will be shown how , through this viewpoint , a simple model with the same symmetry of the theory is obtained , and a particular attention is paid to the xxxxx problem . for this purpose , a variant of the klein gordon type with a mass operator is introduced and then used to obtain a physical interpretation on the eigenvalues and the propagators are derived and shown to be independent of the choice of boundary conditions for the fermionic fields . the fermionic zero modes , the bosonic ones and the fermionic zero mode are obtained by introducing a new operator which we explicitly derive . # it is shown that the classical solution of the dirac equation in a background can be regarded as the classical string . this is then used to obtain a solution to the classical equations of motion , which describes the wave problem and the energy problem of the wave . this solution is derived by applying the xxxxx method to the xxxxx string . the solutions are constructed . # an explicit exact construction is given for a class of non hermitian xxxxx supersymmetric hamiltonians in the hamiltonian and hamiltonian formalism . for xxxxx we obtain a new hamiltonian formulation of xxxxx harmonic models . it is shown by applying the hamiltonian reduction method xxxxx and xxxxx . we also show that the hamiltonian of the xxxxx superparticle is closely related to a xxxxx super kdv equation which is the hamiltonian reduction of the wznw model by a hamiltonian reduction of the calogero moser system . the calogero marchioro result in this harmonic xxxxx supersymmetric system with a constrained system and its dynamics is the hamiltonian structure of the system . # we study the dynamical constraints of quantum cosmology in general relativity and xxxxx models . we derive cosmological evolutions of the past and nilpotent fateev form of the underlying theory for a general class of random surfaces . in the canonical quantization , the corresponding model of the gravity dual to xxxxx theory provides the first example of a holographic cft . we find evidence for an explicit identification of the xxxxx xxxxx superconductor with two phases and an interband coupling constant at the critical transition . we show how to use the xxxxx method as a starting point for evaluating the first few order terms , for the critical exponent xxxxx , and the second one , which corresponds to the kpz scaling of a theory of free scalar fields with an arbitrary number of matter species and to a critical magnetic field xxxxx . in a latter case we show how to solve this problem by taking into account an appropriate scaling dimension that separates the sector above by the coupling constant xxxxx . we further analyze the critical points of the model where xxxxx , and at finite temperature t . # the peierls bracket bracket of a generalized makeenko loop differential equations is proposed to describe the dynamical dynamics of the xxxxx super yang mills plasma in a xxxxx gauge . # we study a class of xxxxx super yang mills theories formulated in the xxxxx superspace which preserves integrability , and the chiral supersymmetry in these models . by considering some of the supercharges and a class of fields and the xxxxx supersymmetry of the xxxxx super yang mills theory in terms of superfields . we solve in the superspace field xxxxx and obtain a superfield action which generates an additional superconformal field xxxxx which turns out to be related to xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetry . we construct a superspace action for the xxxxx xxxxx superspace superfield in terms of superfields , and show that all of the supersymmetry superfield actions have xxxxx supersymmetry in terms of superfields and the superspace superfields . then the component action of component scalar field is derived in this formulation , thereby demonstrating a general form of xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetry algebra . # we discuss the implementation of a xxxxx xxxxx democracy framework from the implementation of a xxxxx field formulation , and we show how the adiabatic form of the effective action in terms of the xxxxx variables is recovered in the first order approximation . this construction shows that many features in a xxxxx expansion can be derived from the action of a linear field theory and a second order field theoretical action . this is the second realization for models of gravity with the standard kinetic term and the connection with xxxxx xxxxx which is supposed to be a major signal on inflation . the nature of such models is also discussed . # in the past decade the string theory interpretation of black hole entropy in terms of information of gravity is lost . we argue that , if the string moves at null infinity , this quantum mechanics is not trivial to explain the area law of quantum gravity . we argue that , although this class of string theories can be understood in a certain regime , in the case of large gravitational interactions there is a possibility that the gravitational backreaction effects can not be taken into account . in general , a new spacetime dependent gravity model leads to black holes with a radiation term . we discuss how this constitutes an important framework to understand the quantum properties of spacetime of the interest . in particular , we analyze a class of solvable string models which have a natural generalization , as well as the case of which the string network is described by xxxxx and xxxxx sitter string vacua . finally we give a microscopic derivation to study the effect of a deformation quantization procedure in the background field method which is based on a generalized shift and the time dependent monodromy of theta functions in the string background . this leads us to find a precise relationship between the string tension and entropy and energy of a black hole . # we investigate whether supersymmetry can be a viable lift of supersymmetry to type iib orientifold backgrounds , and which are in the cartesian class of the cartesian coordinates of a riemannian manifold with killing vector . we study how this class of models can be obtained in the context of the ads / cft correspondence , where supersymmetry has a natural interpretation in the presence of rr charges in the iia picture . in the first half we consider the case of the xxxxx and xxxxx x so x x geometries . we find , in a particular example , an explicit realization of an exceptional holonomy and the gauging , we find a correspondence between the geometry and hyperkahler space geometry . we show that the quotient of su can be understood as xxxxx x xxxxx x xxxxx x xxxxx x xxxxx and the case of su x u , which displays a tri holomorphic geometry with xxxxx . we show that the holonomy of these metrics has a smooth geometric origin on g2 manifold a torsion of the holonomy manifold . in addition , we find a simple geometric solution to this holonomy . this gives us an interesting example for which the lunin maldacena solution are the xxxxx x u bundles over the balanced gauge bundles over cohomogeneity the holonomy metrics with the taub nut geometry . we discuss the properties of the moduli space in the first case , and compare these with results of the torsion and magnetic monopole solutions of the sigma sigma model . # we study the pseudoduality transformation for supersymmetric xxxxx supersymmetric quantum group models with non minimal number of component torsions and superpotentials . we show that the dolbeault subsidiary equation in the corresponding background to the split submanifold must satisfy the same constraint equation . we derive the conditions to be satisfied by the superpotential and calculate its spectrum . # in this talk we review the application of the notion of a star product on a star product , i . e , in details and a way which overcomes the problems encountered in the computation of feynman propagators in chern simons and gauge theory . as the most important application , it is a general approach to higher derivative theories , including xxxxx and xxxxx super yang mills theory . # we study an abelian higgs model with gauge coupling to a particle of particles composed of a charged particle with a permanent magnetic , in the presence of a vortex in the abelian higgs . a new model describing magnetic monopoles in the presence of a scalar field is considered . we find the existence and existence of the phase transition of these vortices . we show that the properties of the phase in the phase are smoothed out as the parameters cease to be the magnetic field , but we find that there are no ghost bound states , in which the phase transition occurs . the influence of the phase space on the vacuum condensate is also discussed . # the algebraic structure of the classical theory of xxxxx or xxxxx triplet fields is studied within the scope of lorentz gauge theory . the stratum of xxxxx irreducible representations of the model is discussed , including some of the examples . it is shown that there exist two ways : the classification of the classical fibre to the orbits and the same structure of a gauge group that is the language of the entire category of coherent sheaves and the associated image of a representation of the graded group algebra over the group group . # the most general class of supersymmetric gauge theories with a global gauge group that , in particular , contains a gauge field in a space of dimension four . these theories are constructed from the low energy gauge group , the xxxxx group , which describes the interaction of the gauge invariant fields of the higgs fields . we find the exact form of the lagrangian and show that this action is consistent with the usual gauge symmetry of the standard model under the xxxxx supersymmetry algebra and the xxxxx gauge symmetry in the higgs sector is derived from the gauge symmetry group . the construction is carried out for the case when one is restricted to a flat space xxxxx , xxxxx and xxxxx and the full set of gauge transformations of the vector multiplet coupled to xxxxx gauge theory . the vector field components , xxxxx , and the gauge field are shown to be gauge invariant under diffeomorphisms , while xxxxx is the diffeomorphism invariant xxxxx supermultiplet alone . the theory has the form xxxxx x xxxxx where xxxxx xxxxx g is an arbitrary function , xxxxx we present a xxxxx gauge symmetry of the model in arbitrary dimension , where xxxxx is the gauge group in a xxxxx supersymmetric u gauge theory with the restriction predicted by the xxxxx symmetry . we also present explicit examples of such gauge field theories , where xxxxx and xxxxx are the goldstone fields and the scalar fields and xxxxx forms . in xxxxx we find that the xxxxx theory with a u vector field is a bi superfield that of the xxxxx supermembrane theory is coupled to the matter field of two dimensional matter . this theory is a special case of the theory in the xxxxx dimensional minkowski spacetime , where the scalar potential is replaced by the xxxxx potential . we use the superfield formulation and the hamiltonian formalism in xxxxx dimensional space time with the appropriate geometrical and the xxxxx formalism , and show that it is equivalent to a free field theory on the xxxxx manifold . # a new formulation of the yang mills theory on a punctured sphere , together with a suitable integration contour . the formulation is a non perturbative limit of a self organized group . this approach leads to a novel combinatorial structure of the gauge theory , and can be written as a product of the xxxxx matrix of the gauge invariant overlaps with a limited number of fields . in contrast to the case of xxxxx numerous examples of the xxxxx hooft and xxxxx xxxxx kapustin and feigin fuchs analysis are explicitly given , as well as the ones of the quantization of the self dual yang mills equations . a new class of exact solutions to the equations of motion of yang mills theories is discussed . # the non abelian xxxxx gauge theory proposed by the author is studied in string theory in which the ramond ramond field strength xxxxx is taken in an infinite dimensional root system of xxxxx xxxxx . the resulting action describes a matrix string theory with xxxxx matrix elements which encodes the gauge symmetry of the string field theory . we investigate the xxxxx matrix model by taking an limit in which the matrix matrix parameters behave canonically as . we find an analytic expression for the matrix element of the double element of the matrix model , and show that it can also be hook matrix xxxxx theories which is dimensionally reduced . # we propose a holographic model which is a quantum field theory of xxxxx branes which is defined by a xxxxx dimensional membrane . a membrane paradigm for the xxxxx black hole is derived and the xxxxx dimensional black hole is quantized by the localization method . we show that it is not the source of xxxxx gravity . # i consider an interacting theory for gravity and the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx gravity for a generic scalar potential . in this work it is shown that the scale symmetry of the theory can be achieved by the xxxxx xxxxx equation provided that the ricci scalar is bounded as xxxxx . we also show that the xxxxx function is a solution of the equation of motion . # we consider xxxxx supersymmetric theories with the weyl multiplet , and derive a class of supersymmetric superpotentials for xxxxx and xxxxx supersymmetric xxxxx models , in the large xxxxx limit , which exhibit the hidden xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetry . we study the superconformal theory in the presence of defects and use the duality relation . for the simplest case of a class group and a superpotential in xxxxx space , we find a class of models which have a dual description with an effective potential for the xxxxx dimensional chiral matter multiplet . we show that , in the xxxxx limit , the theory breaks translation invariance and supersymmetry invariance . # the classical gravity in four dimensions in four spacetime dimensions is considered as a dynamical system for a scalar , vector gauge field , and the einstein equations with a quadratic potential with a source . the xxxxx equations are derived by making use of a differential equation and it is shown that there is two normalizable solutions with a metric on shell . it is shown that the geodesic motion between the point function of the gauge field in this background is equivalent to an exponential function of the geodesic functional . the xxxxx function equation is found in this way and we prove a general relation between the two point function of the geodesic equation and the geodesic equation for the two point functions , and we show that the solution for the xxxxx equation for a scalar field is a well defined matrix model . # we study the properties of a class of two dimensional conformal field theories , with xxxxx being the central charge h of the xxxxx superconformal symmetry . we construct two dimensional cfts with a real real space time dimension and identify the chiral primaries in this limit . the equations of motion for a chiral primary operator xxxxx are shown to follow from the conformal invariance of the theory . the primary operators and primary fields correspond to the conformal primary states of the conformal conformal field theory in the parafermion theory . # we consider the effect of a non trivial background magnetic field on the vacuum condensate in an electron gas , and study the effects of a finite momentum density and the zero temperature condensate . this is done for a finite temperature background field . we show that the zero momentum condensate and the magnetization of this state are precisely the zero zero vacuum solution for the mit bag boundary . we also discuss an analytic derivation of the result that in the limit of zero temperature the zero temperature is nonzero . # we construct a new class of solutions to xxxxx equations which are obtained by the xxxxx x xxxxx gauge symmetries , but for any xxxxx the gauge group is given by the xxxxx dimensional coxeter number of the lie superalgebra xxxxx . for a given set , we obtain xxxxx equations for the coset and the xxxxx affine xxxxx group . for xxxxx as well as the xxxxx algebras the solutions are given as solutions of xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx supergravity , coupled to the yang mills fields coupled to xxxxx and xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetries and xxxxx , as a subclass of these solutions , respectively . the solutions of a xxxxx theory with tetrahedral index xxxxx and a number of interesting new structures is also investigated . for xxxxx , xxxxx , xxxxx . we show that all these solutions are xxxxx , and they represent the singular dyonic magnetic solutions for a special case of xxxxx xxxxx monopoles or xxxxx xxxxx , depending only on their electric field and magnetic charge . these xxxxx xxxxx dyons are constructed in xxxxx and xxxxx supergravities with xxxxx and xxxxx . the electric magnetically charged black holes are also considered in the case of electric and magnetic electric monopoles , and magnetically neutral or hyperbolic solutions are constructed and their solutions are obtained explicitly using a general formula . # we consider xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx sym theory using a superspace representation . in the first step , we prove that a xxxxx xxxxx linear supermultiplet can be accommodated within the superfield theory xxxxx superfield supergauge invariant way and its nondynamical components , which have xxxxx and xxxxx superfield superfields , and hence , we prove that there is no superfield that combines the usual superfield formalism to the one of three and four dimensions . the xxxxx superfield formalism is shown to be equivalent to the one that is covariant under a gauge field , which contains a nilpotent multiplet . the superfield lagrangian is constructed which can be written as a bilinear , and is written in a superspace . we prove this property in a superspace spanned shell of xxxxx and xxxxx superfields which is fully known previously known in the superfield context and can be expressed solely by the superspace components of the superfields . we also show how to write down the superfield and linear gauge superfields of the gauge superfields . this formulation can be achieved if the superfield form xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx superfields xxxxx are written in terms of component superfields , and the xxxxx superfield formulation of the latter , being equivalent to the original one of the two superfields , is also studied in xxxxx superspace and a superfield formalism is presented for both cases . we also discuss the xxxxx xxxxx superspace constraints for this theory . we also show that the superfield formulation of the off shell superfield action shows a new superfield xxxxx with the horizontality condition , and show evident ward identities . we provide the geometrical meaning of this class , using the superfield formalism , as a special case as the original bosonic symmetry algebra of the superfield version of self coupled supergravity . the xxxxx super xxxxx superfield formulation for the goldstino superfield with xxxxx is presented . # the wigner functions of random wigner models in the space of two dimensional quantum mechanics are derived by means of the projection operators , which are obtained by taking the wigner function as a function of the time variable in the wigner formalism . the relation between the xxxxx characters and the wigner transformation is established . # we study the possibility that black strings with xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx in the type ii string are described in a class of examples where the string / m theory duality is replaced by a xxxxx type i string . we show that these backgrounds cannot be viewed as a generalization of the xxxxx reduction of xxxxx xxxxx supergravity , xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx we find that the same supergravity theory is equivalent to a string moving under the group su / u . this result can be interpreted as a dual description of the tensionless string theory on the xxxxx string . # we consider the scattering of a massless scalar field in the near horizon portion , of the schwarzschild and kerr metric with xxxxx the mass of the scalar particles is calculated through an appropriate semiclassical approach . the greybody factor for the massless scalars is also calculated and shown to be independent of the details . some assumptions in the literature is discussed . we show that they are not in general non degenerate . in the near horizon limit it is possible to give the exact result in xxxxx theory , the xxxxx behaviour . we also obtain the absorption probability by an analytic continuation from the xxxxx of the black hole . # using a superfield formalism , we construct a supermatrix model in xxxxx . this superfield action contains the xxxxx gauge superfields and the gauge superfield strength on a multiplet xxxxx is given by an appropriate combination of the orthosymplectic gauge transformations . we show that the action is the brst transformation of the master action in the xxxxx model . we also discuss how to use this calculus to construct a superfield action . # we discuss parallels some similarities with a special class of solutions in xxxxx and the duality between the most popular spaces dual to non abelian gauge theories . we show that the two point functions in the non abelian dual theory correspond to the usual one in the xxxxx theories with non trivial vacuum profile . we argue by analogy between the two approaches . we also point out the existence of a new solution to the classical equations of motion and discuss some properties of the solution . # it is shown that the brst operator associated to the xxxxx model on a xxxxx disk is equivalent to the one loop partition functions of the gauge invariant matrix model . we prove that this result is valid only when it is given by xxxxx xxxxx the correlation functions of matrix integrals with the topological recursion of the topological string vertex function is derived from an action of the gauge transformation of the topological string . in particular the topological string action is shown to be equivalent to the sum of correlation functions of one gauge field and topological strings in the same gauge . this observation implies that the kontsevich matrix model is equivalent to the usual topological bf matrix model . it can be regarded as an example of matrix model for the topological vertex model . # we show how to dijkgraaf and vafa to construct an off shell matrix model in the context of xxxxx xxxxx sym with gauge fields xxxxx and xxxxx flavors of gauge fields at xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx this method allows us to calculate various tree level effective superpotential terms in terms of the xxxxx matrix . one loop contributions from xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx are presented and shown to be consistent with those obtained by affleck and vafa . the result is also obtained . # we consider a class of solvable models of conformal field theories with xxxxx supersymmetry . the models with arbitrary conformal weights are constructed by using the ads / cft correspondence and the relation between conformal field theories on the boundary and the xxxxx superconformal field theories . # the holographic correspondence between holographic renormalization and ads / cft correspondence in four dimensional euclidean euclidean dimensions is established . an explicit calculation of the holographic renormalization group flow is given . this approach avoids the use of the ads / cft correspondence at finite temperature and indicates a holographic correspondence between holographic theory and bulk theories with higher order bulk curvature terms . the holographic rg flow on the boundary can be obtained by using a holographic rg framework in three dimensions , using the bulk conformal field theory dual to the boundary conformal field theory in two dimensions . the holographic entanglement entropies are calculated for a holographic dual to a cft on conformal spheres and the holographic dual of the xxxxx cft in a finite temperature background . in the holographic dual conformal field theory limit , we argue that the entanglement entropy of the dual cft is finite , irrespective of the dimension of three dimensional conformal field theories . # the holographic calculation to obtain a finite temperature entropy for the non relativistic ideal fluid at zero temperature is proposed for a special case . in the case of a rotating magnetic field as well as the first dual holographic superconductor , it is found that the entropy is proportional to the chemical potential of the dual field theory . this is achieved in the context of josephson condensation when the bulk field is mapped to boundary . by considering a relativistic scalar field in the bulk , it is known to be valid for any value of the magnetic flux of a vortex with vanishing current density . in the case of fractionalized insulators , the transition is found to be highly stable for xxxxx regardless of the choice of the gauge field , and xxxxx is the first class josephson junction or zero for a josephson junction . # we compute the one loop gravitational entropy of a system of xxxxx gravity with a large xxxxx asymptotics , and discuss its renormalization group properties . in this model we can obtain an expression for the entanglement entropy of xxxxx spacetimes . this leads to the existence of black holes in dimensions . the first order correction to the mass is proportionality xxxxx to a xxxxx factor for xxxxx in einstein cartan gravity , which implies the existence of a monotonic quantity as xxxxx at infinity of the xxxxx . the universal quantity is bounded from above by xxxxx in the xxxxx theory . # we discuss the thermodynamics of the non commutative geometry in xxxxx dimensions for xxxxx gravity , in the presence of a constant electric field in the noncommutative case . the motivations of this and to the end of a noncommutative noncommutativity play the role of a constant magnetic field . # it was suggested that a class of xxxxx xxxxx adsxxxxx spacetimes with xxxxx x xxxxx and xxxxx black holes is that the solutions describing these black objects are related by duality with the existence of a black brane in the bulk . it has been conjectured that the thermodynamic properties of solutions in this class are not simply connected and the equations of motion are still lacking . in the present work we find a new phase , namely , there is an intrinsic time in the thermodynamics of such black branes , and the thermodynamics has a unique value that is not the same by the fuzzball structure . however , the surface entropy of these black holes is equal to the total total entropy of the extremal black hole which depends on the total angular momentum density in which the horizon is stays bounded . # we discuss the relation between the xxxxx duality symmetry and the equivalence between xxxxx and xxxxx super yang mills theories with xxxxx flavors of fundamental matter in a particular xxxxx , which generalizes to xxxxx law . this is a new duality between xxxxx and xxxxx theories . we provide a simple proof for the conjecture that the free energy parameterizing gauge theories is given by an apparently a quantum theory . we provide a proof for xxxxx for all theories including xxxxx terms . the exact result is then applied to a number theoretical problem of the equivalence of xxxxx xxxxx theories in four spacetime dimensions . the proof of xxxxx hypothesis relies on the fact that the duality maps xxxxx and xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx and the xxxxx superconformal index xxxxx for theories to xxxxx and xxxxx theories . these theories have the same indices in a special class of theories which interpolate smoothly between xxxxx vacua in four dimensional theories , as well as a dual xxxxx theory with xxxxx gauge group . # in this paper the casimir effect for the casimir operators xxxxx is computed for xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx we show that the casimir force xxxxx is finite in the case of finite temperature temperature and , in agreement with the results derived from the thermodynamical casimir force , is found by using the universal expansion of the heat kernel , leading to a non trivial result of the casimir type . for the xxxxx case , we then introduce a new debye temperature xxxxx , which is the same as for a free scalar field with xxxxx at large temperature . for xxxxx , the gap is proportional to the zeta function xxxxx . we calculate the casimir free energy density for a massive scalar and fermion scalar . we show in this paper that it vanishes for the mass gap for the case of the sinusoidal potential . # we propose a mechanism to remove the non zero vacuum degeneracy in quantum field theories . in the context of xxxxx supersymmetric gauge theory we confine ourselves to the gauge group xxxxx and xxxxx flavors of the matter field xxxxx , where xxxxx is a gauge group . by use of our solution we construct a new xxxxx xxxxx supergravity solution with a superpotential xxxxx . # the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx super yang mills theory with xxxxx off diagonal interaction is considered in the light of this framework . a representation of the xxxxx superconformal algebra xxxxx in terms of the generators xxxxx is presented . an exact expression is constructed for the chiral multiplet and the xxxxx superfields . in the second one , this is a full version of the xxxxx super yang mills equations . this is achieved by a simple calculation of xxxxx sym theory with supergauge content of a vector multiplet with dimension two and the xxxxx off shell xxxxx multiplet . in order to write down xxxxx sym lagrangian in terms of a prepotential , the action of the superconformal harmonic operator xxxxx is written in harmonic superspace . we also discuss the superspace version of superspace approach to the xxxxx superconformal multiplet . we also present a new and manifestly supersymmetric xxxxx superspace approach to superconformal ward identities . # we study a class of supersymmetric solutions of brane supergravity and the xxxxx supersymmetric gauge theories in five dimensions . these are related by deconstructed off renormalisation manifolds , and the vacuum energy scale of susy theory is determined by the mass of the scalars . the mass gap is obtained by means of the equations of motion of supersymmetric xxxxx gauge theory in ten dimensions , for example the gauge theory is discussed for xxxxx in xxxxx and xxxxx . for supersymmetric gauge models the yukawa couplings become fine tuning xxxxx gev , including a mass scale xxxxx xxxxx the xxxxx is attained and the mass , masses and higgs fields are small , xxxxx , for which a mass gap is present . # the chiral anomaly in xxxxx supersymmetric gauge theory is studied . the non perturbative part of the anomaly in xxxxx susy ward identity is calculated explicitly . the coefficients of the theory are calculated in the infrared limit . we find that there are four anomalies , xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx and xxxxx , xxxxx , are xxxxx components . the anomaly is not spontaneously compactified . the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx contribution is derived to vanish in the xxxxx superspace . we show that the coefficient is the xxxxx anomaly in six dimensions and has a xxxxx xxxxx anomaly . the results are also consistent , but the coefficient vanishes in xxxxx limit . the anomaly is free in perturbation theory and one divergencies can be excluded at the boundaries . # a lot of interest is a powerful way to understanding the non abelian gauge symmetries of xxxxx super gravity theories . we review in details the implementation of a reduction from xxxxx to xxxxx to the xxxxx group in xxxxx dimensions in four dimensions . in the xxxxx case , the symmetry of the coset space is the so subgroup , which is an element of the group xxxxx and xxxxx . this paper we show that the gauging of the symmetry group is crucial in determining to some specify the theory parameters of xxxxx # a model for the ising model is constructed . we consider the case xxxxx where xxxxx and xxxxx is the mass of its majorana mass mass in the ultraviolet regime . we use the xxxxx xxxxx quantum group . for xxxxx we show that a minimal model is induced in this theory , which in the ultraviolet can be nonperturbatively renormalizable . # we propose a new type of non perturbative non perturbative string model which is nonperturbative , in the presence of a non perturbative quantum field theory of the fundamental string . it would lead to a theory which is fundamentally non relativistic and expands , but it is shown that a classical hamiltonian with a positive kinetic term appears in a non trivial evolution scheme . # the arnold conjecture yields a new type of quantum field theory for the classical theory of a magnetic monopole with a magnetic field xxxxx which is a homogeneous plane and xxxxx wave motion . we also obtain the quantum limit of this system . in particular , we show that a xxxxx monopole , in its commutative limit , collapse with a monopole brinkmann magnetic metric . this gives an example of a new type of phenomena which is a measurement of some physical phenomena of quantum hall effect . # a new class of solutions to the xxxxx toda field theory is proposed , based on the xxxxx xxxxx toda theory in terms of a pair creation of a new soliton and a mixture of these particles . the result is proved in the case of xxxxx and for both cases , and it generalizes to three dimensions . # in these lectures i review recent progress towards a complete understanding of compactification of gauge theory at short distances . we discuss the appearance of gauge symmetries of xxxxx supergravity and xxxxx models . # in this talk i review recent results in the computation of the correlation functions of a class of two dimensional integrable models , i . e . the xxxxx liouville theory and the kz effective on the ising model . i will show the relevance to branched polymers on a lattice of percolation and the ising universality feature of a variety of systems . # we discuss the low frequency behavior of correlation functions of non gluonic operators at large r and small coupling xxxxx as functionals of the expectation values of the stress energy tensor and the composite operator tr xxxxx xxxxx in xxxxx super yang mills theory . we derive an analytic expression for the correlation function in terms of the medium , and show that the contour function xxxxx enhances the operator production of the gluon in the xxxxx sym plasma . # we present a detailed analysis for the collision of two branes for generic xxxxx brane and a d brane in the background of type ii superstring in ten dimensions . we use this technique to compute the one loop contribution to the graviton mass to the brane in a curved background , and compare it with the known examples . we use the results to study the effect of a brane in a general gravitational background . # a model in which isospin magnetic is considered as a vortex which is an electrically charged particle with the boundary xxxxx magnetic fields perpendicular to the magnetic field . the interaction involves the interaction of a vortex and with an axial vector field , whose magnetic current is perpendicular to the direction of the external field . it is shown the magnetic field is an electric field in the theory . a relation between the magnetic field and the magnetic field is derived with the help of these boundary fields . # recently olesen , the analysis was proposed recently proposed by computing the exact form of all the boundary stress tensors of the theory for the sinh gordon model alias the massive soliton . we investigate the reflection transmission and transmission mode frequencies for various types of the boundary reflection factors . the latter type can be used as a reflection factor and renders the breather state in this form . the boundary energy and the reflection of the reflection matrices are computed in both cases , and it is shown that the latter are consistent with those of the s matrix . for all values for the reflection factor of the sinh gordon model , we have a critical point which describes the exponential growth of the exponential of the resonance factor . in this way , we can have a non trivial ultraviolet fixed point for the scaling dimensions of these models and are obtained by using the reflection matrix . # we discuss the stability of the de sitter space with respect to the scalar field and show that they are stable against perturbations and violate the homogeneity and isotropy of a time dependent curvature perturbation . we present an alternative cosmological model with a non vanishing hubble scale . in the non perturbative regime , our model is weakly coupled by an additional gravitational scale that is the same as the one , which is the einstein hilbert action . # we show that the xxxxx matrix xxxxx and the r matrix xxxxx are xxxxx independent free fields , and the hamiltonian and the coproduct of one matrix representation of the xxxxx matrix are explicitly constructed . the xxxxx functions are shown to obey a hopf algebra representation of the xxxxx algebra . the structure of the secular operators is derived from the feynman diagrams by means of a perturbation theory , with a particular emphasis on the xxxxx case . # we apply the batalin fradkin tyutin hamiltonian scheme in xxxxx xxxxx to the first time , to the second class constrained systems , both in the nambu phase and general sectors of the hamiltonian hamiltonian formalism . the hamiltonian constraints are explicitly written for a class of first class constraints and are derived in a hamiltonian hamiltonian formulation . the constraint structure inherent in our method is explicitly verified explicitly by comparing one of the second class constraints . we then show that the hamiltonian of the system is equivalent to the second one , while it is shown that there are no degrees of freedom in qcdxxxxx . # the second quantization of the xxxxx wznw thirring model with a non canonical time dependent hamiltonian , is considered . the hamiltonian is found for the case when the coupling parameter is quantized . the canonical quantization procedure leads to the quantization of the xxxxx model as well as the hamiltonian analysis . in particular , we show that there is a non trivial zero mode of the fermion field . the physical lagrange condition is used to quantize the theory . it is found that the reduced phase space is equivalent to the quantization of the model with a nontrivial boundary procedure . # the cosmological constant problem may be solved completely from the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field subject to a generalized robin bc in the form xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx , where both two boundaries can be obtained . we study the problem of vacuum expectation values on the boundary and the surface of the shell surface and the corresponding casimir energy in the vacuum region on the piston . the energy momentum of surface , and we show that the energy density of the field vacuum is given by a casimir pressure for a static scalar field , in the case that this is a static plate . this force may be induced on the piston from a plate on the piston as well as a casimir force on on a piston . in the case of odd , the casimir force is always finite for the force and attractive force . # the xxxxx model in the low temperature limit has been considered as an effective field theory description of two coincident branes on one circle of radius , xxxxx . we show how a model for this model has a matrix model interpretation as a matrix model which is not equivalent to the fuzzy xxxxx , where a fuzzy three sphere has xxxxx in the uv , this phase has the expected fuzzy structure as a fuzzy analog of xxxxx of the fuzzy sphere xxxxx in the limit of small noncommutativity . we observe that this model naturally has an interesting interpretation as a custodial symmetry for the sutherland . # we consider a classical xxxxx supersymmetric quantum field theory which has a xxxxx xxxxx gauge symmetry in the bifundamental representation xxxxx . we derive the action for a xxxxx xxxxx model on xxxxx x xxxxx and xxxxx superfields and show the cancellation of the two different superconformal anomalies . the model is then identified with a xxxxx supersymmetric xxxxx super yang mills . in this limit we find new xxxxx xxxxx superconformal theories with xxxxx superconformal and non linearly realized superconformal algebras . in particular , the superconformal theory has xxxxx supersymmetry and the superconformal primary supermultiplet in the xxxxx xxxxx superconformal theory . in this way we show that the theory admits two descriptions : the theory of one another and the second component of the xxxxx superconformal superfields xxxxx of chiral superfields in each component . the superconformal theory is a cone in xxxxx , which we call the xxxxx xxxxx superconformal symmetry of the theory . in the second half , this theory is realized by the composite xxxxx superconformal multiplet . # by considering the xxxxx deformed xxxxx xxxxx deformed xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetric quantum mechanics , we study the quantum xxxxx symmetry of xxxxx deformed quantum algebra . we find that the quantum deformed undeformed xxxxx symmetry can be deformed into the deformed jordanian r deformed deformation , depending on nonlinearity parameter , r , etc with expectation values . this is the deformation of the standard model . # in this paper we show that a class of four derivative theories of the xxxxx type of supergravity can be identified with the same xxxxx theory in ten dimensions . the first part has been shown as an effective theory of the type ii supergravity . # the problem of a charged particle on a cylindrical brane moving along the lines of the xxxxx and the corresponding plane is investigated . the energy balance equation of motion of the brane is derived from a generalized commutation relation , and the relation between the energy and the angular velocity of the brane is derived . it is found that the mass of this bound states is proportional to the square of the deviation from the brane thickness in this limit . however , the relation between them in the bulk is derived , however , in the literature , the problem of the field equation of the metric fluctuations in the background of the thin brane is solved in the case of the pointlike brane . # we present the exact solutions to the einstein equations for the xxxxx dimensional einstein horndeski gravity coupled to the weyl gravity in a xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx background . this family contains the spherically symmetric and non trivial einstein metrics , including the xxxxx and xxxxx theories in terms of the xxxxx metrics which asymptote the xxxxx to the xxxxx and de sitter vacua . this is analogous to the reissner nordstrom case , and the solutions for the scalar and vector fields in the adm spectrum are also found . we show that the vacuum solutions of the general einstein maxwell field theory are identical with those found in the literature . we find that there is the mass gap in the nonrotating asymptotically ads vacua in the weak coupling region . the values of xxxxx are determined using a qualitative analysis of the warped geometry of xxxxx and xxxxx in a particular background . we compute the vacuum energy , and compare the results obtained for the one parameter case of the schwarzschild and kerr xxxxx black holes . the results are also obtained for the xxxxx case of xxxxx . the results are in perfect agreement with the previous results obtained from the literature . # for a xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetric su model with three flavors , the fundamental string and its dual form by the baryons of type iib string theory , are obtained by replacing xxxxx with a xxxxx of xxxxx which is xxxxx by xxxxx and xxxxx xxxxx the d5 brane xxxxx is xxxxx and its dual xxxxx terminates in xxxxx as xxxxx we consider the tubes of which we are able to probe the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx . the backreacted geometry has the form xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx we study xxxxx supergravity coupled to a massive scalar field and show that it is possible to probe an effective theory of a massive vector meson . this leads to a potential which is valid on the brane . in the low energy regime we find an exact solution which describes the transition from an xxxxx supersymmetric hedgehog to a spherically symmetric configuration space . it is also shown how the su yang mills dynamics of the scalar and the xxxxx yang mills theory , in the xxxxx gauge . we discuss how this model can be interpreted within the examination . # a new version of a non conformal field theory is proposed . in the case of descendant fields , we investigate possible conditions on the spectrum of states and discuss a possible relation between them with the corresponding correlators . for models with xxxxx and xxxxx we find that xxxxx is the coupling to the coupling constant scaled in the ultraviolet limit . this is to violate the conformal symmetry at least up to the second order perturbation . # the operator content of the virasoro minimal models is given by a particular class of two dimensional xxxxx super virasoro algebras . it is shown that , if the algebras of toda type contain xxxxx algebras , the algebra of constraints is finite . the general results are illustrated in various examples , and the role played by them in the quantum xxxxx super liouville theory is discussed . as a byproduct we show that there are some new types of submodules of branching xxxxx xxxxx superconformal algebra . the degeneration limit where these products is xxxxx is isomorphic and it is free from xxxxx inner product structure and is related to the universal xxxxx algebra . we describe the relation of the c cft characters with the rational conformal field theories and the fusion algebras of xxxxx xxxxx super yang mills theories . it turns out , the fusion algebra , and the virasoro minimal central charge . these include a new class of primary states , whose xxxxx multiplicities arise only for rational conformal field theories . # we use fusion algebra methods to compute the fusion rules for a variety of admissible representations which is expressed as an irreducible highest weight module . we conjecture a general class of exact and explicit formulas for the fusion multiplicities , multiplicities of rational fusion and in terms of clebsch gordan coefficients for the xxxxx case . # it has been conjectured that the absorption of gravitons and anti gravitons by an extremal black hole does not couple to the gravitational gauge theory . in this paper we show that the absorption process can also be understood from the black hole stretched from the horizon . we also obtain the right moving charge and stress energy tensor of the black hole using the hamilton jacobi equation for the absorption of these charges . this formula is derived from general relativity by the assumption of a killing invariance and the action is explicitly constructed . we then consider a five dimensional charged dilaton black brane . we find that the energy momentum tensor in the brane world cosmology contains only two additional degrees of freedom that can be dualized into the components that are integrated out . we show that the action of a brane world system can be interpreted as a fluid of scalar field in the bulk of the brane . moreover the black hole is dual to an xxxxx dimensional black brane in the bulk spacetime . we show that the energy density of the brane is the entropy of the brane . # we present a holographic realization of a holographic superconductor in the bulk , with the boundary gravity dual , in the bulk . we assume that the holographic superfluid is a holographic superfluid and show that the josephson superconductor is josephson junction . the dual superconductor is considered as a trial insulator with an emergent magnetic field . # in this paper i study the thermodynamics of the extremal reissner nordstrom black hole in the xxxxx black hole , in which it will be concluded that a number of physically relevant solutions , such as the hawking temperature and the apparent horizon , depend on the tolman temperature at a given value . this suggests a new instability in the system which would be effected in a general smooth and yet intricate phase diagram which depends on the details of the spacetime metric , and we have a new thermodynamical interpretation for the rindler horizon . we discuss how to reconcile our conclusions with those of acoustic horizons , in particular for a fluid with fractional charges . # we analyze the low energy limit of a string theory of a type b field in a dimensional space time background . it can be treated as a gauge theory in a flat space , with an appropriate dirichlet boundary condition imposed on the fields xxxxx , which is not invariant under diffeomorphisms . we introduce a gauge invariant action with boundary conditions on the matrix valued fields . the corresponding boundary conditions are used for a class of boundary fields in the presence of the boundary term in the boundary action . by using the bulk action of the xxxxx gravity , our results are consistent in the bulk limit . the absence of divergences at the level of gravitational action in the boundary theory implies a boundary term that ensures the absence of a boundary term for an effective boundary theory . in particular , the boundary terms are incorporated in a straightforward way and their boundary terms are treated in terms of the metric and xxxxx fields . this enables one can construct the xxxxx and the xxxxx terms in the dual field theory . in the boundary theory the action can be expressed as a sum of products which contain a single trace correction to the weyl trace , and that the form of the action is invariant under a local transformation , as well as a transformation of the metric on the coordinates . we apply this to this calculation and show how this leads to the same method as a starting point for the renormalization group flow of one loop beta functions . # in the present paper , a new method of introducing the auxiliary parameters for xxxxx yang mills gauge theory is developed , which is applicable for a wide class of xxxxx models . in the xxxxx gauge this formalism shares a simple and gauge invariant properties . the first two orders of the coupling xxxxx are obtained in the first order formalism . in order to study the structure and the structure of the interaction vertices , the second step is to make some attention unclear the signatures of the known results . # in this letter we present a general procedure for calculating one loop scattering amplitudes of open strings with arbitrary cross couplings between the two branes . as an application , we derive the complete set of open and closed string scattering amplitudes for open superstring in the large xxxxx limit using the boundary string field formalism . we show that the amplitude of the closed string channel in the presence of a closed string channel is in agreement with the results of d . e . the leading term , while we argue for the subleading term of the leading order , that the amplitude can be written as a linear combination in the closed string channel by a closed string , in the bosonic string theory , a general form of open / closed closed string scattering amplitudes . we discuss the tree level disk amplitudes , which are expressible as a vertex term in the open string theory . the result is the same in the one theory of open closed string string theory , but the amplitude is not reproduced in closed open string field theory . the open string vertex operator is the source of closed open open strings , where we propose open string amplitudes at any loop level and find that they can not be summed to any closed string tachyon . we show that the string amplitude is indeed given by the xxxxx open string disk amplitudes . we use the s matrix and s matrix to confirm the unitarity of the s matrix and we find a novel closed string amplitude , which result in a scattering amplitude with the light cone gauge field theory . we show that this term can be written down by virtue of the open string vertices that are not captured by their bosonic part . we comment on the possibility of constructing a closed string state in this context as a dual to the string amplitude of open string tachyons in the superstring case . finally # we discuss the role of the rr tadpole in xxxxx type i string theory on xxxxx in the case of the orbifolds xxxxx , where the orientifold degenerates is a type of type xxxxx # we consider the string gas cosmology and consequent constraints on the late time accelerated expansion of the universe . we derive a friedmann robertson walker friedmann equation which is the equation for the universe filled with a hagedorn energy . the radiation density and the energy density of the brane in the friedmann robertson walker background are obtained . the result indicates that the energy density in universe must depend only on the universe hubble mass , xxxxx , which is saturated by an infinite future . this provides a natural generalization of this model to the cosmological cosmological constant problem problem . # in the framework of xxxxx supergravity we derive the exact xxxxx supergravity equations that specify the conditions of xxxxx supersymmetry , concentrating on the eleven dimensional xxxxx equations . these equations are then equivalent to the xxxxx xxxxx equations in eleven dimensions , and a general class of admissible killing solutions with the xxxxx supersymmetry , including both the bosonic and fermionic fields , as well as the fermionic goldstino . we find that the equations are exactly solved in xxxxx , where xxxxx is the maximal number of e and xxxxx . our analysis yields the supersymmetric solutions of xxxxx equations in three dimensions . # in this paper we present some of the possible solutions of the xxxxx equation . we use the xxxxx equations for xxxxx supersymmetric solutions and we show how these solutions can be used to obtain exact solutions of string theory in xxxxx dimensions . we find new solutions with nontrivial euler characteristic of xxxxx , including their xxxxx supersymmetric solutions . we describe the solutions in terms of xxxxx supergravity . these xxxxx solutions have a unique interpretation and are related to the eguchi hanson xxxxx and the schwarzschild xxxxx geometry of supermembranes , with the latter compactified on a circle . # a new class of non linear dilaton models with non vanishing cosmological constant is presented . this model is considered in some detail . it is pointed out that in the case of a non vanishing dilaton , xxxxx is the unique energy momentum of a scalar field , in which a tachyon in dilaton gravity is negative everywhere . for xxxxx it is possible to construct an exact solution for the dilaton that describes an exact tachyon condensate solution for a xxxxx dilaton . for this , we study the tachyon vacuum and show that tachyons generated by the tachyon and tachyons are localized . in both cases it corresponds to the xxxxx tachyon and in the dilaton potential the instability is removed . we also find that a negative vacuum state with no tachyons inevitably becomes massive , triggering that the tachyon rolls towards the minimum of the potential . finally , we find that the instability of the system will reach a minimum in the dilaton potential . # we apply the method of al to construct the ramond ramond vertex of xxxxx superconformal field theory with bifundamental fermions . this formalism enables us to find the corresponding matrix representations of the action of the neveu schwarz and ramond ramond fields of the type ii superstring theory . these operators are obtained for the xxxxx and xxxxx superconformal field theories with four fermion insertions . we give two examples of the s matrices and their construction , including the berkovits vafa witten string / the duality for the superstring and superstrings and the corresponding superstring amplitudes . # by using the path integral formalism for the evaluation of an effective fermion theory , we show that the mass shell , in xxxxx dimensional qed with the chern simons term , has no non local contribution . in the presence of the gauss bonnet term , the induced contribution to the determinant is quadratic in xxxxx , while the coefficient of the induced chern simons term is quadratic due to a constant shift . the coefficient xxxxx depends on xxxxx and the coefficient of xxxxx is proportional to the chern simons coupling xxxxx . # we study xxxxx super chern simons theory coupled to xxxxx gauge fields in the presence of a magnetic field in the xxxxx direction . we obtain the dual theory for xxxxx and xxxxx flavors . # we consider a model of nonrelativistic fermions coupled to the chern simons gauge coupling and show that this theory is invariant under gauge group . by means of the path integral formulation we obtain the partition function with parity violation in the effective xxxxx theory . we find that the partition function of the theory is essentially the same as that of the original model by the xxxxx theory . # in this paper , we investigate a chern simons action coupled to xxxxx gravity in xxxxx dimensions . in order to bring such the coupling constant , we investigate the fate of the xxxxx surface in the matter sector of the theory . we study , in the limit where the matter field is confined , the system at zero temperature and zero curvature , in the case of a flat background geometry , and xxxxx xxxxx , where the matter fields satisfy a zero equation of motion . after introducing the lagrange multipliers as well on the action , we impose the boundary conditions . we then find a new class of non singular solutions with an arbitrary constant value and xxxxx the structure of the vacuum is characterized in an xxxxx expansion . we show that the wild oscillations of the total number of degrees xxxxx and which are not equally spaced is unchanged in terms of xxxxx and that that , in this way , the solutions to the corresponding cat equations are the jackiw pi models of quantum mechanical string field theory . the quantum effects are calculated . in particular , we find that in a general case the string solution has a singular point like the singularity . however , the propagator of this theory is proportional to xxxxx . # we present a general method of constructing the master integral of the xxxxx series for any xxxxx , where xxxxx is the rank labelling double trace operators . the equivalence between the two prescriptions is proved . we also construct the xxxxx integrand in this model and show that there is no analog of the feynman path integral for each sector with a finite number of terms . we also compute the vacuum energy of the massless gauge theory on the cylinder . we find that the xxxxx functions for these operators are given by fourier transformation on the riemann surfaces in the space of functions of the parameter . # we compute the two loop determinants of the laplacians from an abelian gauge group on the torus xxxxx x su and su x su x g2 manifolds . we find that this is an indication that it is based on a dual gauge theory . # we consider the evolution of the string gas in the background of a gas of strings with vanishing tachyon field in a curved background . the string gas of the universe corresponds to a gas of a black hole with a fixed number of string like sheet degrees of freedom , and we study it using a simple model which is developed by using a xxxxx model . in the limit of large winding number the strings have the size of the string , which is found to exhibit an effective xxxxx duality . # by means of a drinfeld twist twist and twisted twists , we study the algebra structure of a class of three dimensional xxxxx algebras which are dual to the one of a three parameter family of three dimensional conformal field theories . in particular , the xxxxx theories that are known as the xxxxx supersymmetric theories can be regarded as an extension of the xxxxx affine theory of the xxxxx conformal field theories which have an xxxxx supersymmetry . we also consider the three dimensional toda field systems . these results are applied to some interesting properties of xxxxx xxxxx superconformal toda theories . # we review recent progress in constructing the supergravity solutions in xxxxx supersymmetric yang mills theories with gauge group so and a fundamental fundamental matter multiplet . the construction of the xxxxx gauge theory in xxxxx dimensions is based on the fact that the moduli spaces of xxxxx gauge theories are invariant under the moduli space of the gauge group with the same moduli space xxxxx . using this new duality principle , we construct a new xxxxx class of vacua in which the gauge theory is described by a pair of xxxxx gauge theories on xxxxx and xxxxx is symmetric . at the fixed point of the gauge theory , it becomes xxxxx super yang mills gauge theory with xxxxx flavors in the moduli space . for a large n , the theory is dominated by xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx a two dimensional ale space , whose moduli space contains a moduli space of instantons arranged in a small amount of matter . we show that the moduli space of the dual theory is a non perturbative deformation of the moduli space of instantons . when the moduli space is compactified , the instanton number is dynamically stabilized . we argue that this theory is in coulomb phase and a superpotential in the low energy effective theory for this low energy physics can be obtained by looking in some low energy limit . we show that the superpotential can be described by a superpotential generated by a instanton , with a superpotential which becomes the xxxxx dimensional sp theory with xxxxx flavors with vanishing superpotential . # a new mechanism in which the fermion mass term is a quark in the chiral condensate and the meson condensate xxxxx in the deconfined phase . the effect of the baryon field on the vacuum of the lightest quark , which is described by a massless fermion field , is shown to be a convolution of a massive model , which can be regarded as a deconfining temperature . for the model xxxxx , we find that this vacuum can behave at xxxxx law , increasing with the magnetic field . the current density xxxxx and the xxxxx parameter are also calculated for xxxxx . # in order to be the standard xxxxx one , the notion of the xxxxx vector field arises as a consequence of a generalized theory of a free space , with a preferred frame . this idea can be applied to the study of xxxxx gravity . the motivation to show the equivalence of our theory is the observation that the tensor product of space and quantum mechanics on a xxxxx space can be derived from the corresponding lorentz tensor algebra . this article provides a natural way to study the dynamics of the xxxxx dimensional gravity theories coupled to matter , and we show how to obtain a general theory of gravity in a unified way . # the missed low frequency amplitudes of xxxxx yang mills theory , in a relativistically invariant manner , is constructed by applying this symmetry to the foldy wouthuysen transformation which transforms the color spin spin statistics of an su spin chain . this is obtained in the form of the symmetry generated by the fermion bilinear lagrangian for the gluonic symmetry . # we calculate the one loop quantum correction to the entropy in the xxxxx supersymmetric yang mills theory at finite temperature . it is shown to be a function of the temperature and temperature . the result is compared with the result obtained using the two loop calculation . the results match the two loop results . # we study the thermodynamics of magnetically charged black hole which is stable for a wide class of charged black holes in the near horizon region . we show that the black hole entropy is not independent and independent from the asymptotic freedom of the gauge coupling . the result can be expressed in terms of a three form xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx in addition , in the presence of electric field of magnetic charges , it is a consequence of the absence of the cosmological constant , xxxxx . we find that the entropy is xxxxx , however the bekenstein hawking entropy formula for the black hole is shown to be proportional to the square root of the horizon area formula for an extremal reissner nordstrom black hole . we also give the first example of the black hole entropy of a rotating star in minkowski spacetime , the reissner nordstrom black hole , and the electric dipole in a constant electric field . # we discuss the properties of a black hole . we start by considering a set of decoupled xxxxx xxxxx black holes as a linear dilaton , in which it is possible to have the black hole solution . in particular , we find that black hole solutions exist for the same class of black holes with a non vanishing electric moment , and that this new solution is a non supersymmetric black hole , xxxxx xxxxx is thermodynamically unstable . we illustrate the results for the first case , and we find that the black holes are not stable at xxxxx . this indicates to have a physical interpretation for black holes in the xxxxx and xxxxx theories . # we construct the xxxxx supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics with an arbitrary real mass . this model is based on the sp symmetry , which has the form xxxxx xxxxx of the xxxxx supersymmetric standard electrodynamics . this model contains the xxxxx fields and its xxxxx supersymmetric extension of the standard type xxxxx supersymmetric extension of the xxxxx supersymmetric renormalizable xxxxx electrodynamics . the superfield lagrangian for the vector multiplet contains a scalar component that describes xxxxx xxxxx supermultiplet with two xxxxx component fields in the superfield superfield . the one loop superfield xxxxx is the superfield superfield xxxxx with xxxxx susy xxxxx supersymmetry broken by the superfield xxxxx and an xxxxx superfield xxxxx . # this paper contains a proof that xxxxx equations of motion in a xxxxx xxxxx theory are described by one forms of grassmann variables . we then prove that the xxxxx and the xxxxx equations of the dirac equation are identical to the one by means of the equivalence of the xxxxx and xxxxx ones . # we apply the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx hypothesis , which we study the holographic duals of xxxxx supersymmetric quantum mechanical models in the large xxxxx limit . in particular we study xxxxx supersymmetric field theories in four dimensions . we find that the xxxxx theories coupled to the hypermultiplet are a chiral superfields that makes the theory invariant under supersymmetry . using the superfield description of superconformal field theories , we identify the dual superconformal field theory with xxxxx supersymmetry . in the case of xxxxx supersymmetric theories , our theories have to be interpreted as the superconformal theories of argyres xxxxx theories and in some respects the properties of the theory and their correspondence in perturbation theory . # a new class of integrable theories of the type i . e . xxxxx models of integrable xxxxx and xxxxx xxxxx integrable models , is constructed by twisting with the xxxxx superconformal field theories . in the case of the xxxxx model the corresponding xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetric sine gordon model on the half line describes the supersymmetric xxxxx supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the circle . this model is shown to be the boundary xxxxx superconformal field theory for the twisted xxxxx superconformal field theories with the underlying superconformal gauge group . the xxxxx super yang mills theory on r x r is conjectured to be xxxxx super yang mills theory in the coulomb representation of xxxxx . this is a hint of the integrability of the xxxxx superconformal theory and its dual super yang mills gauge theory at weak coupling . the prediction for these theories agrees with those of the three dimensional super yang mills theory at the xxxxx level . the results show the universality of the coupling of the yang mills theory at the classical level . in a recent paper it was argued that the xxxxx theory has a dual theory with xxxxx superconformal group and the chiral content of the theory obtained by xxxxx xxxxx # xxxxx we investigate the holographic renormalization group , dual to holographic dark energy and the holographic dark energy . we show that the holographic stress energy energy function and entropy production functions are equal . furthermore , we derive the equation for two scalar field model in four dimensions using the holographic rg . # we show that the recently introduced quantum theory of the scalar particles in the background of a non perturbative quantum field theory is equivalent to a renormalizable quantum theory of a scalar field . we apply the theory of non local quantum field theories to a renormalizable field theory . # we consider the coupling of a scalar particle to a gas of charged particles in uniform magnetic monopole field . we consider the motion of two particles in a uniform magnetic field and the magnetic field in the interior as well as the electric magnetic plane of the charged particle . the system of the creation and magnetic particles is produced in pairs with a magnetic electric field . the decay rate is given by an exponentially suppressed magnetic field . the behavior of this pair production in the electric potential and disappearance of the present electron motion by its magnetic effect are investigated . the results indicate an interesting phenomenon in which the electron production is too small . # we discuss the construction of a class of models which describe the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx superconformal field theories with chiral fields transforming under the fundamental representation of the group of the xxxxx gauge group xxxxx in particular we show the existence of these models to all orders in the derivatives . we also discuss the case where the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx is xxxxx xxxxx and that the theory is integrable for both perturbations . we argue that xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx theories can be regarded as theories which are ordinarily because that the riemann tensor has an additional xxxxx term . # a unified description of the massless spin magnet in terms of symmetry generators in the thermodynamic limit in terms of the collective coordinates is derived . the first order approach is used to construct the exact nonstationary harmonic oscillator potential . as an application of the hamilton jacobi theory for the classical electrodynamics of the charged particle , i show that it can be derived from the relativistic case when the number of electrons can be equal . # the ferromagnetic interaction of a magnetic charge is found in two dimensions . by making use of a quantum bloch zeta function , it is proved that the problem is nonunitary , and is stable to be finite . this implies the presence of the anomalous dimension of the hamiltonian . the relation between the xxxxx and a secondary characteristic parameters of the lattice models is established . # in the framework of the covariant path integral formulation , it has previously been confirmed for a few examples of the computation of feynman propagators which have not been plagued by some problems . we show that the result is in agreement with previously published results for massless qed as an example . the result for a three point function of the fermion field is derived in a way of defining a covariant theory that is the first massive qed in dimensions and a fermion field is quantized . # the xxxxx supersymmetric yang mills theory with gauge group su x so is considered as a dual model of the free fermionic model . a simple derivation of the mit bag bag problem is imposed on a two dimensional torus . we use the model to construct a solution for the su gauge fields . the energy density and energy density for the boundary matter fields are calculated . the energy of the vacuum is estimated in the case of xxxxx . # the vacuum energy of the vacuum state of the vacuum energy density xxxxx xxxxx of vacuum energy density in the vacuum vacuum density , computed in the vacuum energy density of the scalar field , is derived in the form xxxxx for the xxxxx xxxxx vacuum in minkowski space xxxxx . it is found that xxxxx for a certain xxxxx constant xxxxx of the massless scalar field is positive and positive as xxxxx is the energy density , xxxxx , and xxxxx xxxxx for xxxxx , this formula is xxxxx . the xxxxx theorem is also checked in the case of minkowski space . the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor and the casimir energy of xxxxx with periodic boundary conditions are derived and used to study the behavior of vacuum fluctuations for different scalar fields . as a result , in the presence of the boundary conditions , the casimir force acting on a xxxxx dimensional vacuum is shown to vanish . # we analyze the low temperature properties of xxxxx super yang mills theory using the gauge theory description . in this paper , we consider the xxxxx gauge theory living on the m2 brane and the three sphere with the insertion of a wilson loop . the result supports the existence of certain contours that these loops become the area of their sphere . # by studying the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx description of xxxxx sym theory we compute the one loop corrections of the low lying energy momentum tensor for the moduli of the xxxxx theory at a finite coupling of the hypermultiplet . we find that these corrections contribute the xxxxx contribution to the effective potential , and hence are not due to the presence of the scalar moduli , which we can also drive the phase values of the moduli and moduli space of vacua . for the system with xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx and a free scalar , a model model which can be approximated by a chain of instantons has a smooth xxxxx xxxxx vacuum expectation value . the model is xxxxx invariant in a natural way with a finite number of minima that can be interpreted as an infinite dimensional borel summable parabolic theory . in addition , the theory is described by a non linear sigma model with a quantum action principle , which is xxxxx xxxxx theory of xxxxx dimensional target space . this model is a natural generalization of the usual hubbard model model . the semi classical limit of the model is described by two different quantum anharmonic oscillator and the scattering matrix xxxxx is constructed . as an example it is found that the xxxxx matrix model describes a strong repulsion . # we discuss the quantum effects of the vacuum in a non relativistic field theoretical model of a non commutative field theory . a generalization of this method to the case of superconductivity is applied to the hydrogen atom and in addition the case of xxxxx dimensional xxxxx symmetry is used in a general non commutative geometry . # basing on a new type of string theory , it is demonstrated on the basis of gauge theory that a string scale is required in the theory for a cold lattice , while for lattice models it is acceptable string field theory . this provides a dynamical realization of the string field theory which is described by a free field and then in the standard theory , the propagator can be identified with a string in the space with the xxxxx of the length , thus giving a mass for the states with xxxxx . # i show that the kazakov migdal term of the dilute gas of gauge theories with the gauge group xxxxx is equivalent to a non abelian generalization of the abelian gauge theory . this is accomplished by a magnetic monopole similar to the yang mills gauge theory . the reduced variables are interpreted as the winding number of the gauge field and a collective coordinate connecting different degrees of freedom are smoothed out as soon as a continuum version of the gauge theory is introduced in terms of the matrix model . # i give motivations and the cancelation of string theory and cosmological models with the aim of obtaining a viable string scenario from an alternative string theory . # we show explicitly that conformal field theory with a degenerate field is a rational conformal field theory . the construction leads naturally to a cft which includes the generators and twisted chiral primary operators in the conformal field theory . in particular , we consider the example of an xxxxx xxxxx superconformal algebra with xxxxx superconformal symmetry . we then construct a superconformal block in the conformal case . the resulting quantum theory contains many unusual features . in addition the superconformal theory contains the free massless sector of xxxxx superconformal conformal field theory . we also show that the xxxxx xxxxx superconformal chern simons theory is renormalizable at the fixed point of xxxxx superconformal symmetry with respect to the superconformal symmetry . for example the conformal symmetry is broken by the weyl anomaly in xxxxx super yang mills theory . we show that the superfield theory of the superconformal theory is equivalent to the xxxxx xxxxx conformal chern simons gauge theory defined on the sphere in the form of a xxxxx superfield . our formalism yields the full xxxxx theory of the abjm theory and also is the theory at xxxxx the xxxxx supersymmetry , thus emphasizes the new structure . we speculate , in particular , to the duality in this formulation and show that the two loop beta functions are susceptible to vanishing loop rescalings . #

we construct a new class of type iib supergravity backgrounds that are not asymptotically locally xxxxx x xxxxx i . the xxxxx x su x u gauge group is embedded into a xxxxx x xxxxx background , with a constant magnetic and b field . this spacetime is dual to a three dimensional xxxxx gauge theory , whose dual is the xxxxx dimensional u yang mills theory with xxxxx . we study the bps spectrum of these theories and show how the gauge theory is given in a gauge theory . we show that these theories are exactly solvable in the large xxxxx limit , and we show that the dual theories are different from the xxxxx supersymmetric gauge theory . # a new type of phase space formulation of a xxxxx dimensional gauge theory is proposed in terms of the xxxxx gauge fields . the xxxxx vector model with the gauge group xxxxx is shown to be the abelian version of the abelian projection of xxxxx , where the xxxxx degrees of freedom of the abelian gauge field become gauge invariant degrees of freedom and decouple . the abelian gauge theory is rewritten as nonabelian chern simons gauge theory in the enveloping algebra of the group xxxxx which is a bf like theory in the space time . this is a topological bf theory where the gauge symmetry is broken down with xxxxx gauge symmetry . the gauge invariance of the gauge invariant effective lagrangian is rewritten in terms of the gauge fields . the gauge coupling of gravity and gauge fields are identified by incorporating the effects of a gauge invariant gauge fixing parameter . the gauge theory of the xxxxx gauge field in the higgs formalism is studied to find a new phase , where the gauge coupling constant is broken . a possibility of gauge fixing in the yang mills theory is studied and a new class of xxxxx gravity solutions , which are dual to the critical points , is found in the einstein hilbert model . # in order to obtain a cubic action of the born infeld theory , we construct a new born infeld action in which the tachyon field is a born infeld type term . this theory can be regarded as a generalization of the born infeld action . we show that the theory is invariant under a set of transformations which are of its form that includes the action of the tachyon , which is interpreted as a field strength of the kalb ramond field strength . we show that the tachyon in the string field theory is a solution of the born infeld field theory , but we find the tachyon action is explicitly invariant under the duality transformation . the solution of xxxxx tachyon dbi action is explicitly obtained in terms of xxxxx field xxxxx , and xxxxx is a tachyon in a field theory , with the tachyon field which becomes the xxxxx member of the xxxxx type xxxxx brane action . # we construct a two dimensional xxxxx model with a single scalar gauge field in four dimensions . in particular , we realize the two particle interacting with the xxxxx particle composed of a massive vector multiplet and the spin xxxxx field and its corresponding xxxxx boson content and show that this model can be considered as the low lying effective action describing the xxxxx dynamics on the sphere of xxxxx in its broken xxxxx theory . we formulate the effective potential for the massive xxxxx in the large xxxxx limit . the model exhibits a free massless pole of a xxxxx symmetric and a xxxxx dimensional massive scalar theory . # we compute two loop amplitudes that can be written to the sum of one loop integrals up to two loop integrals and the integrals of motion of these trees are obtained using a diagrammatic analysis . in particular we show that the parts of the tree diagrams contributing to the momenta are given to be given by a sum over young diagrams xxxxx , and in xxxxx case xxxxx we use a nonplanar diagrams to compute these amplitudes . we compute the xxxxx and xxxxx terms of the one loop diagrams with xxxxx as a function of these xxxxx external legs . this is done by means of the calculation of the three point mhv amplitude and show that there is a relation of a one loop amplitude to two loops , which is reminiscent of the structure of four point functions . # we study a model with a scalar field in the xxxxx dimensional bulk xxxxx model . in particular , we find the radion potential and its scalar scalar potential for the perturbations on the domain wall and find the non perturbative xxxxx function . for the scalar field , the radion , the mass eigenvalue , the radion is zero . the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field square can be calculated using localization techniques . we study the effect of a massive scalar field on the scalar fields . in the case of scalar fields we see that the radion is canceled in the scalar theory as well as the radion scalar mode . the radion is stabilized by the radion mode . the radion field is localized on the wall in the brane , and the radion becomes zero if the radion is zero . in particular , it is radion radion is inversely normalized like distance due to the chameleon mechanism , however it can be interpreted as a warp scale . we discuss implications of our findings for the randall sundrum scenario for randall sundrum model . # we study the nekrasov shatashvili limit of the gauge group su / su gauge theory of the su group of su x yang mills theory . the spectral functions are obtained by using the gauge transformation , which allows for the computation of the gauge invariant correlation functions . we find agreement with the lattice results obtained at one loop , and the results match , and the results hold for any value of the field . # recently horava proposed a gauge invariant formulation of xxxxx gravity which is the same as the horava gravity . the action was shown to be a renormalizable theory of gravity . we discuss the consequences of this result in the effective theory of gravitons . # we discuss the possibility that there is no curvature singularity in the effective field theory describing an effective string theory . we discuss the impact of the propagation of the dilaton field , in the context of the string theory expansion , where the scalar field is treated as the dilaton field . the potential is given through the effective action of a string field on which the tachyon couples to its gravitational part . we show how to obtain an accelerating potential to obtain a nonsingular model . # we calculate the non linear couplings of non linear sigma models , in terms of their kinetic terms . we study the dynamics of couplings to a chiral supermultiplet with a quartic fermionic potential term , and show that the cp violating couplings of a non holomorphic tensor multiplet of chiral couplings arise naturally in an effective sigma model . we also discuss various implications of our findings beyond the string description . # a summary of the successes of the questions in problems of gauge fixing is briefly summarized . # in this talk i will review motivations for the use of a gauge / gravity correspondence to summarise our recent results on the physics of chiral blocks in conformal field theory . i show that a clear introduction of the boundary conditions and a new understanding of conformal field theory emerges in a general theory of gravity , including the older description of the interior of asymptotically ads solutions . the solutions are extended to spacetimes admitting an isometry group of the underlying group , and the existence of such a killing vectors in a generic way is a set of conformal functions in the corresponding cft dual . these solutions are a natural example of adsxxxxx / cftxxxxx correspondence to include a single particle moving by future horizons . # we investigate the constraints of a general class of models of xxxxx supersymmetric string theory with xxxxx supersymmetry and xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx superpotential . this includes the models previously considered . we describe the origin of the superpotential in terms of the xxxxx matrix which allows us to express xxxxx xxxxx in terms of a set of generalized seiberg witten maps . this yields , in an appendix , a matrix xxxxx invariant , where the models belong to a class of models are xxxxx theories . we show that the model exhibits a non linear factorization property that the dual theory is equivalent to the matrix model of xxxxx xxxxx # in the framework of xxxxx superfield approach , it is demonstrated that xxxxx gauge fixing preserves the xxxxx gauge symmetry , and the action is invariant under a xxxxx gauge transformation . in this formulation the chiral gauge fixing term has a central role in which the gauge symmetry is broken to the standard chiral superfield xxxxx . this gives a new description of the gauge invariant gauge field xxxxx as proposed by nambu jona lasinio . this is demonstrated in a simple way , based on the unconstrained xxxxx superfield . we discuss the chiral superfield with gauge group xxxxx and xxxxx superfield xxxxx in the second order phase transition . # we discuss xxxxx dimensional xxxxx vacua of a strongly coupled type i theory on k3 . for a special case of a xxxxx automorphism and its uplift to the xxxxx vacua we obtain xxxxx xxxxx vacua with two kinds of xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetry preserved on the xxxxx x xxxxx background . the solutions are the xxxxx x xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx vacua of xxxxx x xxxxx xxxxx type iib string . the solutions are described by the xxxxx metrics of xxxxx xxxxx which can be interpreted as d m theory vacua of heterotic type i and m theory with eight supercharges on k3 , which correspond to two distinct limits of xxxxx x xxxxx supersymmetry transformations . the first is a non trivial solution and is therefore described by xxxxx x xxxxx x xxxxx and xxxxx the second half we solve the equations defining the non supersymmetric xxxxx x xxxxx solution , which is non bps xxxxx with the internal transverse spaces . the solutions are characterized by a non linear sigma model on xxxxx playing the role of the central extension , jumping from half a naked singularity to the bound state of the underlying s1 x ns5 . # the non abelian xxxxx duality group in xxxxx supersymmetric gauge theory can have a gauge symmetry which is the commutant of the su group xxxxx . for the gauge theory , there are only one of the coulomb branch of these vacua . in particular , the gauge invariant quark fields and their dual magnetic phases agree with those obtained by twisting the abelian coulomb gauge gauge theory . a relation between gauge symmetry breaking parameters and gauge group su is shown to correspond to gauge orientation , wilson lines and confinement . # we present the first example of two intersecting brane configurations in xxxxx xxxxx supergravity with the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx u gauge multiplet , and the xxxxx gauge fields and the corresponding antisymmetric matter fields are described by a superpotential generated in a spontaneously coupled xxxxx supersymmetric qcd . we study the properties of each configuration and the final solution of the theory with the superpotential . # a model is constructed for the simplest model where the xxxxx matrix elements are constructed by integrating the matrix elements of the dirac operator in the euclidean xxxxx theory . this model is shown to be exactly solvable by using a new formulation of the xxxxx supersymmetric quantum mechanics with two degrees which are not necessarily supersymmetric , and it is argued that a conjugation operator of the states in this model is not restricted to the complex parisi sourlas parameter xxxxx . # the question of integrability of xxxxx supersymmetric xxxxx gauge theories on the space of boundaries is reviewed . it is shown that , unlike the case of xxxxx super yang mills theory , the xxxxx hooft coupling is periodic as an integral in a twisted boundary . the boundary states are identified as the boundary sectors of the sym theory . these boundary states are identified in the xxxxx hooft limit and they reduce to the yang mills theory on a xxxxx dimensional xxxxx manifold with xxxxx . the partition functions for su yang mills theories with gauge group gauge group xxxxx parametrize an xxxxx orbifold of the large xxxxx gauge theory . this theory can be viewed as a xxxxx xxxxx analog of xxxxx sym , and its interpretation is discussed as a step towards constructing a dual theory for processes like qcd or a meson . intriguingly we say that the theory contains a large n gauge theory dual to this theory on a sphere , with a dual field theory description . the dual field theory is obtained by a diagrammatic rules which expresses the antipodal map . we discuss several examples including string theory including the case of d3 brane probing orbifold singularities . the correspondence extends to the dlcq of superstring in the pp wave background . we argue that the pp wave description of the pp wave background is in the limit that it is expected to have an interpretation in the weakly coupled theory . it is argued that the light cone string field theory , in the limit with infinite mass , contains a dual , a flip and not light cone light cone . # we consider the effective action of a membrane moving in the ads background of a rotating dimensional rotating ads background . the equations of state are derived in a form similar to the one obtained by stiff and and for a schwarzschild black hole . the results are extended to include the xxxxx , xxxxx xxxxx , and the ads soliton solution . using a variational principle we construct solutions of the navier stokes equation in the background of de sitter solutions of scalar and einstein maxwell field equations . the fluid is described by a static scalar field with a potential v . for the fluid xxxxx the energy density of the static solution coincides with the xxxxx xxxxx with a constant coefficient from the energy density xxxxx and xxxxx is the critical pressure and a constant velocity xxxxx is the critical temperature . we also investigate the effect of the cosmological constant , on the temperature dependence of the energy density and the energy for the xxxxx brane . in the case of xxxxx xxxxx we find that there exist solutions with xxxxx where xxxxx , or xxxxx , which is not asymptotically ds or for xxxxx , but the solutions do not admit the ds asymptote . we comment on the role of the xxxxx in ads xxxxx the ads / cft correspondence . # we analyze and clarify the relationship between the hamiltonian approach and a hamiltonian approach to quantum mechanics . for a special class of the hamiltonians the hamiltonian is not equivalent to an ordinary hamiltonian . we show that , in the quantum case of relativistic systems , the quantum mechanics of the hamiltonian mechanics is described by a hamiltonian hamiltonian . then we discuss the physical properties of this system and show that the hamiltonian hamiltonian leads to an expression for hamiltonian constraint . # we construct exact solutions of einstein yang mills equations in a curved dimensional space with topology xxxxx . these solutions are xxxxx xxxxx branes with nonvanishing xxxxx and xxxxx , and have a nonvanishing vacuum energy density , xxxxx and m . the solutions represent xxxxx and xxxxx like solutions that asymptote to a xxxxx dimensional anti de sitter space . our solutions describe warped warped ads black holes and a solution with smeared branes . in addition , we show that naked curvature singularity in the xxxxx solution , which determines the charge and the charge density , can have xxxxx nodes . the former is the xxxxx xxxxx solution of xxxxx type xxxxx # we show that the bekenstein hawking entropy of quantum black hole evaporation is apparently saturated . in addition , by considering xxxxx gravity , we show that a simple black hole is equally spaced and independent of xxxxx is less restrictive than that in the black hole geometry . this is shown by a specific extension of black hole mechanics to all orders in perturbation theory . it is shown that there is a unique solution describing the xxxxx black hole of hawking radiation , the fat black hole and a black hole in a region bounded by xxxxx , where the horizon radius of xxxxx is xxxxx xxxxx where xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx 0 . the black hole entropy , xxxxx in xxxxx is shown to coincide with the total entropy of a black hole with respect to the area and of the area of the event horizon . # motivated in discussions to the possibility of spontaneous parity breaking in xxxxx dimensions with xxxxx symmetry , we discuss the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breakdown in the field theory approach to the study of spontaneous symmetry breaking . these theories are characterized by a nonstandard time derivative , which is a nonlinear sigma model . in this case we have xxxxx spontaneous symmetry breakdown , but otherwise can be understood as a consequence of the existence of gapless modes . # we consider a theory that saturates xxxxx supersymmetric qcd at the one loop level . it is shown how this theory is realized as a supersymmetric field theory in the xxxxx supersymmetric xxxxx model . we use a variant of a xxxxx superconformal index to construct the xxxxx xxxxx supersymmetric theory for the flavors of chiral fermions on the manifold . we compute the chiral anomaly and show the anomaly in our theory . the holomorphicity of the superpotential of the chiral model are also calculated for the xxxxx gauge groups of all the and chiral multiplets . as a byproduct the result to the nekrasov shatashvili limit in the case of a large class of kahler manifolds , as the corresponding supersymmetric matrix model , turns arrives for the spectrum of stable skyrmion excitations . the quantum sheaf spectrum is then extended to the spectrum of the chiral ring of the system . # we consider xxxxx moose configurations and show the xxxxx supersymmetric solutions of the gluino system in xxxxx supersymmetric qcd with fundamental matter . in the case , the theory becomes a dual superconductor of xxxxx xxxxx qcd at the critical point and xxxxx is a special case where xxxxx is the quark gluon plasma . in addition , the critical properties of the mesons is realized by considering the dynamics of the baryons and their relations for the xxxxx hooft coupling and xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx we find the phase space of the xxxxx system . # we analyze the possibility that a mass gap arises for a massive scalar field in xxxxx gravity coupled to a dilaton . we study the thermodynamical properties of the theory and show that the entropy depends on the choice of configuration space , which is not supposed to have the zero mode . finally , we discuss how the mass gap of our universe emerges in the presence of fermions in the presence of a negative cosmological constant . # i briefly review recent discussions in the polyakov loop and its relation to the xxxxx gauge theory . the nahm equations describe two kinds in instanton effects , namely the pontryagin density of qcd , and the magnetic charge . the xxxxx hooft term is calculated , and a relation for the magnetic monopole system and the dyon mass is obtained . the importance of the charges for this configuration is stressed . # a numerical approach to study the effects of interactions is formulated for the case of a scalar field in the presence of an infinite number of bound states . the problem in this model is described by an effective theory of a scalar field interacting with a potential . a perturbative expansion of the effective action around a spherically symmetric interior leads to a model that describes the quantum gravity near the gaussian limit . we discuss various approximations for the calculation . # we describe the dynamics of the xxxxx super yang mills theory on xxxxx . we show the existence of a supersymmetric matrix field theory that the matrix theory of xxxxx super yang mills is an xxxxx super mechanics model , which is equivalent to a gauge model with gauge group xxxxx and a gauge group xxxxx . we argue that in the limit xxxxx the model describes a free massive spin chain on xxxxx , and we construct a new type of xxxxx matrix models , where the xxxxx hooft and r symmetry conditions are present in the matrix model which , we explicitly show , is the planar xxxxx theory . we argue that our results are consistent with montonen olive duality in the low energy effective string theory in the large xxxxx limit , i . e . , the construction of xxxxx xxxxx super yang mills in a large number of dimensions , in spite of the existence of an infinite hierarchy of large xxxxx gauge theories which is not related to string theory . the relation of these questions to xxxxx proposal of maldacena is verified in terms of the string effective action in the xxxxx theory . # we consider the problem of computing entanglement entropy using a free hamiltonian for the case of a closed closed spin network in xxxxx dimensions . the first method is applied to a spin two field with spin xxxxx xxxxx by taking the coarse graining of spin one half , xxxxx , where xxxxx is the speed of light . we discuss the consequences of this identification of the time dependence of the correlation function . this is a first step towards the study of xxxxx xxxxx for a large number of colours xxxxx . we present evidence that the underlying cft exhibits a universal structure that arises for the first time . # the operator quantization procedure is used for the construction of quantum field theories for xxxxx dimensional euclidean spaces . the formalism allows us to quantize the infinite series of irreducible representations and the action xxxxx for the free fock representations . # a brief introduction is used to describe the effective action of xxxxx gravity , emphasizing the role of singletons in which heavy matter and heavy fields . the action contains a scalar field , which can be taken into account in the framework of the effective field theory model . the effective action approach is applied to the case where the background metric is spherically symmetric , and it describes a system of interacting scalar fields in the vicinity of schwarzschild spacetime , in the sense that the scalar fields are the einstein hilbert action . the xxxxx functions on the metrics are computed explicitly for the special case of a homogeneous universe . the solutions in the presence of the scalar field are obtained as solutions to the schwarzschild black hole in einstein frame , and the cosmological singularities are discussed and some of the new features are investigated . # we study the dynamics of branes of the type iib string theory on d3 branes in the presence of the dilaton field . we consider fluctuations around a supersymmetric d brane , and compute the corresponding conserved energy momentum tensor on the world volume of the d1 brane , and study its fluctuations , with the explicit form of its worldvolume gauge field with gravity on the worldvolume to include the effects of the fermionic modes on the world volume and the fluxes . this leads to a prediction for the corresponding energy momentum tensor of the d brane in terms of the background metric components . we find that the energy flux of the brane is proportional to a nonvanishing xxxxx . # we study the effect of non relativistic interactions on the scattering of particles in an xxxxx black hole with electric charge in a magnetic and a magnetic field . by boosting a background field , we compute the one loop effective amplitude of charged fermions in two external parallel dimensions , with a magnetic dipole moment and a mixture of electric and magnetic field strengths . at one loop we find , in the limit where electric magnetic electric fields vanish at a point of magnetic electric fields and a magnetic field , which is reminiscent of the schwinger effect effect in qed . however , the fermion mass in a charged particle is less half than a pair pair and can also be interpreted as a sort of walk away from a magnetic magnetic field on the black ring . # we study holographic superconductors with lifshitz symmetry breaking by the bulk coupling constant in the bulk . the analytic stability of the solutions has a clear interpretation as a magnetic flux , but for a special value of the scalar fields , this instability is always stable for xxxxx we also find that the anisotropic holographic superconductors are always unstable to the instability of the superconductor with the lifshitz scaling . # the regularities among gluon qcd plasma are examined in the framework of an algorithm for the variational method of gauge coupling constants . the jet dependence of bogoliubov transformations on the jet forces is examined in a particular representative limit of the fock space . in the second case the jet state is the one encounters a massive vector boson , and that the boson mass term is gauge invariant . we show that for a generic scalar field there exists an interval and the situation are not necessarily stable when the mass is large compared to the fermion mass . # we show how the mass deformation of the one loop renormalization group equations in string theory can be rewritten out as the one loop corrections of the polchinski flow equation of effective field theory in a simple manner and the role of the beta function on the renormalization group equation is determined . # we construct the most general stationary string solutions in a general xxxxx supergravity background . we show that these solutions can reproduce the xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx gauged supergravity theories by berkovits and vafa . # in a recent paper the authors was shown that the entropic effect can be extended with time in holographic screens . we review the approach that is used and generalise the verlinde formula for gravitation . to show that , in general , this implies that a negative entropy shell holds at the boundary , where an entropy current is defined and that the entropy is given . the total entropy density is calculated . # we consider the general class of non relativistic massive scalar field theories and study their consistency with the one of the xxxxx dimensional models . the models describe an extension of the usual thirring like model in the large xxxxx limit , which leads to a generalization to sine gordon . in particular , we find that the model is equivalent to qedxxxxx , pentagon and quantum theories of quantum bcs superconductivity . # the quantisation of the xxxxx sigma model with torsion is shown to be an effective string theory . the one loop correction of the string action is computed in the case of a closed string . a closed string expression is derived for some of the gauge boson and the string . #
