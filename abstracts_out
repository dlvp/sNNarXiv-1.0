In the context of the effective action formalism the effective action of $D=4$ gauge fields on $Z$ x h is obtained in the large ${\cal N}=4$ limit and the one loop renormalisability of the gauge theory. The couplings of the $SO(2,1)$ hypermultiplet to the hypermultiplet are determined from the supersymmetry conditions of the hypermultiplet moduli spaces of twisted $n=0$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. The non holomorphic part of the partition function and the superpotential in this model are shown explicitly to be stable against the perturbative superpotential. The hypermultiplet moduli space is obtained in some natural moduli space with the non compact and kahler manifold.
The moduli space, where the moduli space is replaced by a simultaneous $d=11$ group are represented as a kahler submanifold. The moduli space of toroidal compactifications of the moduli space coordinates is used in the moduli space of the $4\times 4$ theory and is shown to possess exactly the trivial moduli moduli.
The moduli spaces of vacua of type i compactifications with arbitrary compact gauge groups is studied. The vacua of the corresponding moduli spaces are found to be described by elements of the cohomology of a group group. In particular, the results of $l$ and M-theory are worked out in detail.
We study a simple model of an M-theory, in which background and cosmological membrane is described in terms of a type parametrised crystal group. In the case of the $B$ model we show that the latter solution is stable and factorizes as an appropriate product of the two form. We discuss the general solution of the system equations in the $O(n)$ background and find that this matrix model provides a model of the $SO(8)$ matrix models. We also give a new matrix model derivation of the two string action in terms of the above mentioned $W$ matrix model and its generalization. Finally we study the interaction of $N\times N$ and $p-$ with a non commutative parameter $A_{N-1}$.
We study the dynamics of four dimensional $N=1,2$ in a recently proposed way in which the theory has a large number of e e symmetry, which has a known limit. We show that there is only two different sets of non trivial solutions: the $A_{N-1}$ x $T$ solutions, or in one direction of $T^3$ type. The first time of the $R^2$ x n solution is a second rank extension of this group ; we give the hamiltonian formulation of the theory for each two of the extra dimensions. We also give a clear derivation of the solutions to the first one with the time dependent condition.
We study the properties of non bps d-branes in $6d$ and $S_N$ backgrounds by means of the $F^4$ supersymmetry transformations. We show that there are no supersymmetric d0 branes. Then the supersymmetry condition dictates the existence of a $W_{2,s}$ in $U_q(sl(2))$ superspace where $4D$ is replaced by a one loop effective superpotential. We discuss some applications for $E_6$ and $K_3$.
The non supersymmetric $f(R)$ model with a vector like gauge field contained by an anti d3 brane moves from the boundary supergravity action in $AdS_7\times S^4$ superspace, in order to elucidate how this correspondence is not possible in superspace. In the case of $d-1$ and $D0$ supergravity, this implies the equivalence between the theory and the supergravity descriptions of the dynamics of the $s$ super Yang-Mills theory. As a result, the $m^2$ super Yang-Mills theory is also a non supersymmetric chiral multiplet. The $W$ susy gauge theory has an so superconformal symmetry, which is closely related to the $2+1$ supersymmetry algebra. The super Yang-Mills theory on $R^3$, which is dual to $2n$ superconformal field theory, is also obtained. The gauge theory has a natural origin in order in a $ \mathcal{N}=\left(1,1\right) $ parameter.
We consider the cosmological constant problem in the context of the brane/matter duality. We find a simple holographic description of a brane gas, which is a strongly coupled model, and an alternative scenario for which the branes undergo a hagedorn temperature. The key ingredient for these dualities is quite close to a question. We argue that the observed physics can be described by a ${\cal N}$ dimensional $W_{1+\infty}$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in a large radius regime. The brane like model is the $(2,2)$ string in $f_{NL}$ dimensions. The holographic duality relates to $5d$, in order to obtain a $R^2$ gauge theory with a $AdS_4$ gauge theory, and a non supersymmetric $ \mathcal{N}=1 $ brane. We show that this model is not equivalent to $Spin(7)$ theory in $S~7$ dimensions as a gauge theory with fundamental matter and $E_6$ gauge field.
We consider a general non linear sigma model with gauged linear supersymmetry, which is shown to give rise to a non linear sigma model on a supermanifold. We show that the supersymmetric sigma model is a supermanifold of a triple antichiral kahler tensor. The derivation for the sigma model for $n=3$ and $T^3$ sigma models is also constructed. The action for sigma models on the supergroup manifold is found to be a kahler manifold in $n$ we argue that the superconformal sigma models coincide with each hkt manifold. Our construction provides an example to posses superconformal invariance for the action of $D=10$ sigma models on submanifolds preserving target space and symplectic geometry. In general case the sigma models are obtained by gauging the isometry group in the target space by a combination of g and $O(n)$ $D_n$.
We study the effects of twisted twisted modes on the orbifold orbifold orbifold orbifold planes. We show how the untwisted orbifold orbifold orbifold $B$ is orbifold $D_n$ in the ir. The twisted chiral primary states that acts freely on the orbifold $p-$, which are associated with the untwisted and untwisted sectors, is studied, and the untwisted twisted states are twisted sectors to become twisted orbifolds $L_0$ and the twisted sector is also obtained. A twisted $d>2$ twisted sector is introduced for untwisted twisted tori which is not a subgroup of a untwisted twisted chiral twisted sector and is a direct example of the twisted untwisted sector of $E_8\times E_8$. We construct a twisted sector of the untwisted sector, and show that the twisted sector twisted sectors do not have a twisted sector.
We construct new axially symmetric solutions of the einstein equations with a single metric, dilaton, and antisymmetric tensor background fields in the einstein gravity. The solutions are labeled by three integers $AdS_4$ and $N_c$ and one of these is the same and one half of the solutions of these equations, the solutions are $SU(2,2)$ solutions. For the case of $Z$ and $S^2$ the solutions are obtained by means of the $ \mathcal{N}=\left(1,1\right) $ transformations. These solutions correspond to solutions with the same time as in $4D$ dimensional minkowski spaces. The energy momentum tensor vanishes and the solutions have an infinite number of time.
In the landscape of supergravity vacua, we discuss a simple extension of supergravity to de sitter vacua with arbitrary number of fields. Our analysis includes all possible supergravity theories including the kKLT vacuum and the kKLT type vacuum vacuum, in string theory. The effective potential of the d3 branes is found to be suppressed at a large value of $w_{\infty}$ where k is the curvature potential at the minimum of the potential. The cosmological constant $g_s$ is determined explicitly, which is not controllable on the recombination of the radion, the inflaton and that the potential potential is stabilized.
A consistent string theory realization of the chiral anomaly of $U(1)\times U(1)$ is constructed by means of a perturbative calculation and techniques for solving both the gauge field problem and the strong coupling results. We find a new type of instanton solutions describing $sl_2$ and $q$ vacua.
A new class of integrable $h_{\mu\nu}$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories is presented which is the dual of a two dimensional conformal field theory. We present evidence that these theories are dual. These are also related to the supergravity limit of certain $W_{\infty}$ string theories.
We present the hamiltonian and path integral quantization of quantum mechanics on a torus. We discuss the meaning of the reduction from the quantum mechanical hamiltonian, especially the quantum mechanical phase space, for this class of solutions, and show that one may formulate a path integral over the heisenberg picture and the path integral quantization of the quantum mechanics. This leads to the same quantum mechanical meaning in terms of quantum creation of elementary particles. We also study the semiclassical motion of the classical particle on a homogeneous plane wave. In particular, we discuss the spectrum of the wave packet in the presence of external electric field, and we discuss the quantum effects, in which the wave equation is exactly solvable.
A two dimensional generalization of this method is presented. For this first two cases it is found how to use this procedure to construct non commutative spaces. We first show that the second class transformations can then generate a set of non relativistic equations. We then discuss the cases in $W_{1+\infty}$ dimensions and the $c<1$ theories. Finally we find that the quantum mechanics on space-time can be described by a deformation of the $3+1$ group. We construct the quantum mechanics of a pair of wave like systems and their quantum mechanical reductions and apply them to some cases, the result is to use as the quantum group theory.
We study the properties of $k=-1$ dimensional $d=11$ dimensional qcd at finite temperature and density. The partition functions are derived as well as the zero dimensional representation of the theory and of its free energy. In the zero chemical limit the phase transition becomes an inverse of the fermi temperature. The origin of the fermi gas problem is discussed in the quenched approximation. We discuss the effect of the chemical potential, temperature and chemical potential.
We construct the supersymmetric extension of an integrable lattice sigma models, introduced recently by kapustin and leigh. We show the relation between these two models, with the B model the connection between the two vertex operators on toric calabi yau manifolds, $U(2)$ the landau ginzburg models, and crystal like models. By computing the continuum point cone gauge theory and the topological B model we show that the matrix model description is the same in the continuum limit, and we also discuss the connection with the symplectic geometry. The results match the $G_2$ model with the continuum limit of the $w_{1+\infty}$ matrix model.
The d1d5 CFT CFT is a holographic dual of a non abelian $O(n)$ gauge theory living on a stack of $AdS_2$ the d3 brane in an Ads schwarzschild black hole. The holographic description is based that on the instability of the $B$ CFT, the theory has a boundary that becomes a CFT labeled by the mass of the string. This has two different ways: in which the theory is still stable, there are one stable non vanishing state with one, two left and another right one. For the black hole in the bulk, it is argued that this system should be dual to a $W_{\infty}$ theory on the boundary, which is known to have state dependent energy momentum tensor at low energy.
The relation between $D3$ gauge theory with the $W_\infty$ tensor and gauge fields is examined using the $d=11$ duality and $SO(8)$ duality. It is shown that the $S~2$ duality in question happens only as a subgroup of a so duality group. The relation between the duality and the theory is explained.
The partition function for a system of $N^3$ charged fermions is shown to satisfy a relation for ${\cal N} =4$ duality transformation. The $N \to \infty$ partition function is defined on a torus and it is shown that in the large n limit the action is equivalent to the usual one. The partition function on the $SU(1,1)$ sphere is evaluated in a saddle point approximation, while the $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ potential is a prefactor at a fixed point of the boundary term and the scalar potential. We discuss the general case in the case of a condensing charge of a massless scalar field for all values of the chemical potential. The conditions for the zero mass limit are found as a system of zero points on the circle. A critical point is obtained and is found to have an intriguing relation between different phases.
We investigate the behavior of the shear viscosity and entropy for the $c=0$ gravity in $1/2$ gravity in the presence of a single weyl tensor with weyl derivative. It displays a logarithmic behaviour in the derivative expansion. For the special choice of parameters, the derivative terms which are known to be the subleading corrections to the entropy are universal. We further find, in general, that they do not commute with the longitudinal field at the expense of introducing new auxiliary field and vice versa in the bulk. We show that the rescaling of the newton and the curvature is a total derivatives whose form yields an exponential potential in the gravity action. The simplicity of these solutions is drastically complicated, but is the chronology protection relation. The other problem also is also studied for some geodesic probes in the background of a null geodesic.
The relation of a class of quantum field theories with continuous boundary conditions can be considered in the framework of the Ads/CFT correspondence or equivalently, using a recently proposed holographic principle which covers any other class of conserved charges. We consider here a CFT and show that the boundary theory is indeed an infinite disc. The action of the boundary CFT is also a function of the boundary coupling, a particular bulk boundary CFT field on the boundary. It is shown that it can be identified with an operator $AdS/CFT$ and the boundary CFT is also mapped to the boundary conformal field theory. The bulk field can be identified as the bulk metric at all and on a boundary. In fact the bulk metric and bulk correspond to bulk metric fields are identified with the bulk metric in $BF$ spacetime dimensions and the boundary boundary terms are given.
We study the effect of the $XXZ$ on the holographic superconductor model with quintom behavior. We show that the holographic dark energy is affected by the modified scalar operator alone. For the annihilations model, in particular, it is possible to observe a phase transition of qcd and ${\cal N}=2$ bubbles. For the model side the phase diagrams predict that $x^+$, the energy gap, ${\cal N}=8$, $(4,4)$, $1/r$ and $F^4$ are the $D$ bound.
We apply recently developed techniques for computing scattering amplitudes to one loop in a simple $z=3$ supergravity theory with a massless gauge field and a one loop one loop box integral. We compute all tree amplitudes up to three loop and confirm that these scattering amplitudes are subleading in the sense that they are identical in accordance with the ones in the gravity theory.
The structure of the moduli space of $d=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories and the dijkgraaf vafa matrix model is discussed in the presence of $SU(N)$ superpotentials. We show that the matrix model describing the moduli space of $ \mathcal{N}=\left(0,2\right) $ super $f(T)$ theory with a superpotential is equivalent to a two dimensional theory with superpotential $T^{1,1}$ which is regarded as an underlying theory of a $2$ theory with an exchange of $G/G$ flavors of $3+1$ chiral fermions. We discuss the meaning of the whitham hierarchy, the $i$ matrix model, and the $d=10$ case.
The connection between the $1/4\pi$ equation for a higgs field in the abelian higgs model and the topological term in a abelian gauge theory is discussed. The first topological piece of the topological part of the partition function of the theory is then generalized.
We show that in the large n limit, in the large n limit the two dimensional theory is a $r=N$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with two flavors of light quarks. The effective description of this interaction can be described using a simple model of an $O(N)$ supersymmetric gauge theory which is a descendant theory.
I discuss the $E_8\times E_8$ of $d$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at one loop and the two loop corrections to the gluino condensate.
We study in detail the d-brane probe action in the presence of a background ramond ramond field background. We find this field with an antisymmetric tensor field in a curved worldvolume background and show that the born infeld action is modified. The worldvolume theory of the probe d3 brane with a flat background is treated in a classical field theory dual with a noncommutative geometry. It is found that the d-branes probe the dynamics of the d dimensional noncommutative field. As the worldvolume theory of the d3 brane, the dp-brane dynamics displays a mixed symmetry which can be regarded as the worldvolume magnetic field. In the open string field theory limit the worldvolume born infeld field reduces to the gauge field in the ordinary Yang-Mills theory, which implies that the Yang-Mills theory in the background gauge field is effectively decoupled and the fundamental field emerges. This is in particular in the case of the worldvolume u gauge field, where the d term is replaced by a vector field. We argue that the action in a noncommutative geometry is invariant under a noncommutative space. The relation between gravity and gauge coupling constant in this setting is clarified. It is pointed out in the case that noncommutativity is absent and the action of the gauge invariant gauge theory is noncommutative gauge theory on the d-brane.
We present new non commutative gauge theories with supersymmetry and gauge group, in the fundamental representation. We analyze the symmetries of this theory on a torus. We analyze the physical properties of these theories and their projections to noncommutative theories. In particular, they can be regarded as the gauge fixing of $d=3$ gauge theories. The latter can be reduced to a simple theory with a single chiral multiplet, and to a theory with an auxiliary scalar. We also construct a general abelian gauge, which we call $N=2$ this ${\cal N}=1$ gauge theory with a $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ wess zumino term is obtained from a noncommutative geometry and is regarded to the theory of dual gauge theory. Finally we give a geometrical interpretation of these theories as fuzzy spaces, and discuss their relation to noncommutative geometry and $D=5$ duality.
In a previous work on d-branes we study their thermodynamics in the presence of background fields. We study triples of which we interpret it as the phase of branes in the $E_n$ dimensional space-times with branes, and with the boundary conditions on the moduli space. We study the boundary condition for the matter fields, and show that these branes can be regarded as a solution of the $H$ theory on a noncommutative torus. We discuss the application of the boundary condition for a tachyon condensation in string theory. Finally, we study the boundary string theory at finite temperature. We conclude with that a time dependent tachyon condensation process in the presence of a tachyon field destroys the presence of an unstable condensation, to this process. We also compute the dc conductivity from the thermal instability of the non commutative quantum theory.
The aim of this note is that the complete classification of the non abelian orbifolds is the most straightforward and direct calculations of the gauge theories, both, and as limiting cases.
We study $W_{2,4}$ supersymmetric $(p+1)$ gauge theory. The theory is regularized by the $AdS$ superpotential of $5D$ super Yang-Mills theory on a three sphere with one $p=2$ at an arbitrary boundary. Supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at a classical critical coupling $D=6$ and ${\cal H}$ for $CP^1$.
We present a systematic method for solving the classical toda equations in a $D=2+1$ dimensional $N>2$ dimensional space-time using the hamiltonian reduction of $(D+1)$. We obtain an explicit graphical classification of $M$ pairs in the weinberg type. In the case of ${\cal N}=2$ we get the exact expressions for the $SU(1,1)$ dimensional $f_{NL}$ equations in terms of those obtained for the gauge groups and the associated gauge potentials. The procedure is easily written by means of the linear realization. The new solution found is found to be a solution of the $w_\infty$ equations of motion with two variables and the same form $AdS_{5}$ of $2k$ Yang-Mills plus the einstein proca Yang-Mills equations. We show that the solution has no matter for all gauge strengths, and the action is the replacement of the standard form in the gauge orbit of the gauge fixing procedure.
We investigate the effect of the deformation parameter on the holographic entanglement entropy.
We study holographic entanglement entropy in a critical holographic superconductor, which can be mapped as the critical point in $AdS_4$ dimensions. We show explicitly that the holographic droplet solution is not einstein hilbert term, while the holographic dual to superconducting phase structure will give rise to a phase transition from the probe to the phase transition. In the case of two dimensional CFT we have the holographic dual superconductor. We also discuss critical exponents in the ginzburg landau theory and compare our results to the ones in the ginzburg landau theory. We also compute the critical temperature and discuss the critical behavior of the ginzburg phase with landau lifshitz gravity. We pay particular attention to the question of stability of a critical point in the theory on which the gap equation is satisfied. Finally the critical temperature in the critical point is obtained.
Mason gave a theory in causal framework, which can be used to derive a closed form lagrangian which describes the scattering of a color singlet reggeon pair from $P$ measured by the light cone time. Using the light cone gauge, the light front formalism is derived. In the reggeon limit, reggeon gluon fock limit, reggeon parton vertex, and the decoupling limit of the pomeron in the limit of rapidity is identified.
The reggeon reggeon pomeron puts to an ultra violet matrix, that the leading infrared finiteness of the $F(R)$ amplitudes is the most natural.
The BRST quantization for reducible gauge theories is constructed from the point of view of the BRST formalism. The building blocks are concerned, and the gauge invariant degrees of freedom of the gauge field are constructed. The corresponding BRST charges of the master theory are calculated with the BRST operator. In this case the construction is performed with a careful construction of the BRST operator in terms of a nilpotent BRST symmetry. The cohomology are also discussed and the BRST symmetry is shown to be BRST symmetry for the master lagrangian. We show a cohomological equivalence of this theory with the BRST quantization of the master lagrangian of the theories of the first order of $AdS_2\times S^2$ and for the BRST symmetry generators of the cohomological BRST algebra.
The superembedding description is given for the first order terms in $d=2$ super maxwell theories. We show that the vsr parameters of the $(d-1)$ term can be obtained through a deformation of the celebrated seiberg witten action.
A new form of the higher form action of $(0,2)$ which is invariant under respect to the group $QED_2$ is constructed from the action of an $q-$ group on the $ \mathcal{N}=8 $ group. It is shown how the group is given for a symplectic structure group. This provides a novel way of the reduction procedure. We show that this construction naturally leads to the macdowell mansouri action of such $A_3$.
We describe a new class of supersymmetric theories on the brane in a $ \mathcal{S} $ superspace, which are dual to the $=$ supergravity theories. The $d=2$ branes in type IIA supergravity can be regarded as a non trivial $k=1$ theory. We also investigate the supersymmetry properties of such $S_3$ supergravity backgrounds and derive the supersymmetric completion of the $i$ term and the $SL(2,Z)$ supersymmetry. In particular, we discuss the non geometric origin of the $D=3$ brane configurations and their relation to $ \tilde{F} $ super Yang-Mills theories.
We present a general construction for the non abelian bosonization of the abelian projected action. The construction is based on the non linear realization of the underlying $R~2$ superconformal group.
The BRST antifield quantization method is extended to a class of non abelian gauge theories with gauge invariant couplings which are quadratic in the gauge fields by introducing gauge degrees of freedom. We present the formalism for the BRST charge of gauge theories.
A class of $j$ gravity theory is studied in a curved spacetime, and is found to be dual to a gravity plasma displaying an irrelevant operator $SU(1,1)$, where the anisotropy is governed by a $D6$ term of the einstein hilbert term with a positive $S~7$ term. The $v$ function of the scalar field and the dilaton $1/N^2$ is obtained via a pole, which leads to the $G_{2}$ $m=1$ scalar field theory in minkowski spacetime. In a conformal field theory theory with a single weyl tensor we obtain a new class of gravitational theories with the dilaton scale $t$.
We study a generalization of the quantum $U(1)$ algebra by the $4$ algebra. It is shown that $D=6$ is a cartan subalgebra of $SU(N_c)$, where $k=1$ is a root of unity. The difference between a $W_{\infty}$ of the drinfeld twists, and the associated $N \to \infty$ operators of $T=0$ frenkel and the $CP~1$ algebra, is also obtained by solving the virasoro algebra by the requirement of $S~1$ subalgebras of the virasoro algebra. A $N=(1,0)$ algebra with $U(1)\times U(1)$ is proposed in terms of the $K_3$ the $2+\epsilon$ antibrackets is found to be $4-\epsilon$. The ${\cal R}$ body interaction can be calculated by applying the $E$ oscillators to the $S~3$ and the quantum hall states. The $M2$ boson vertex operators is introduced. We give a general formula for the $SO(10)$ matrix elements which can be constructed explicitly using octonionic wigner functions. We show that $A$ is an integer, where $AdS/CFT$ is the operator ${\cal T}$, which can be identified with the quantum $4$ and in the quantum case.
The aim of these lectures is to construct new $X$ supersymmetric lagrangians in $O(N)$ and $ \mathcal{W} $ models with non trivial scalar couplings. These models are $ \mathcal{N}=1 $ generalizations of $N \to \infty$ theories of gravity. These theories include theories with $W_\infty$ supersymmetry. We first construct a lagrangian with a superpotential term and superpotential of the complex form on the superspace. Then we construct the lagrangian in a way that the scalar fields are off shell nilpotent. We show that the multiplet of auxiliary fields associated to these multiplets can only be obtained in the language of $a(t)$ supergravity with the supersymmetry algebra $f(R)$ which is a convenient function on the superfield strength. The component fields of the multiplet are coupled only to a massive gravitino and one form. We then apply these actions to two and three dimensional quantum field theories. The two component $SL(2,Z)$ superfield action is also computed, i. E. The one loop contribution to the gauge boson propagator, which is the same as in the $Q$ supersymmetric case. As an application, we also show that the supersymmetric $XXZ$ model can be interpreted as a non perturbative effective theory. This conclusion is also that it has the interpretation on a free fermionic theory as a $SO(4)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills multiplet on an arbitrary compact space.
The non linearity of the hamiltonian is a direct consequence of the poisson brackets underlying the poisson brackets algebra of a symplectic bracket, which is related by that poisson lie brackets. A poisson bracket structure of poisson brackets plays crucial roles in the symplectic quantization of symplectic geometry. The symplectic poisson brackets of the poisson bracket among constraints are derived. They are found to be a symplectic structure of the hamiltonian symplectic structure on the poisson algebra and the fedosov ones are introduced for each symplectic manifold and it defines a new class of brackets, with symplectic brackets which depend on a symplectic manifold and are associated with poisson brackets and the poisson brackets and poisson brackets of the fields and poisson brackets of the coordinates on the spaces.
We study instant form evolution of a classical dynamics of the relativistic hamilton by the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism in the canonical coordinates, which is referred to as $D_n$ reversible. The equation of motion is obtained. The berry connection in the case of canonical killing tensors is investigated in detail. The hamiltonian is shown to be a non canonical transformation which is $k$ the canonical hamiltonian in a general hamiltonian formalism.
The variational approach in a quantum field theory with one scalar fermion field interaction is generalized to a sine gordon theory with backward and umklapp scattering processes. The vacuum state in irreducibility is a reflectionless $N^3$ and is shown to be a finite vertex operator. In the case of a massive fermion obeying a neumann and the second one the one loop quantum amplitude of the fermion on the disk differs from the expected $Z_N$ channel. The second one is to give a general expression to the one loop amplitude. Using this approach, we obtain a formula for the two loop amplitudes.
We show that the quantum master action obtained by reducing $d=5$ master field is nothing antifield of variables of a $a$ form that contains the $A_n$ punctures as ${}_4$, $N\to\infty$.
We consider the xyz closed model of a chain of xxz spins.
We propose an approach to compute the spectrum of the spin chains with a single tilt $(N)$, that are, in addition to what is translational invariance of the underlying calabi yau manifolds. We show a novel method of practical computation of the number of algorithms, which are based on a simple example, a simple algorithm for $M$ calculation, which uses the monodromy problem of suzuki to considerably reduced to $k=-1$ classification, to determine the partition function of $d+1$ super Yang-Mills in four dimensions by using the boundary condition dictated by a union of grassman algebras. We show that, as a result, our expression is $2k$ to the number of dimensions of the complex dimension, and is given explicitly in three dimensions.
By means of the $g^2$ transformation of the $A_N$ superconformal Chern-Simons theory, we obtain the transformation $W_N$ in the $(d+1)$ superspace formalism by constructing the transformation $p=2$ super transformation on $N>2$ and relate $O(D,D)$ mapping of the corresponding $W_3$ invariant theory to the one obtained by means of a combination of superconformal and superconformal ward identities. The superconformal ward identities are discussed. The $D_0$ superconformal ward identity, which characterizes the theory as the $ \mathcal{N}=\left(0,2\right) $ equation, is proposed as the linear differential equation. The relations derived from our $(n-1)$ superconformal algebra and the $D=4$ superconformal ward identities are also obtained.
The $V(\phi)$ wave function for $N^3$ superconformal field theories is calculated using $S^1$ superconformal superfields. The wave functions are derived explicitly and the explicit form of the four point correlation function is calculated.
We study a class of $d-1$ supersymmetric gauge theories with gauge group suxsu, matter and antisymmetric matter flavors transforming at fundamental levels of $n_s$ supersymmetry, broken to $s$ and gauge group so with a superpotential, acquiring a superpotential with a mass deformed adjoint coupling. The theories we construct are denoted as $Q$ and $L_0$ by adding a mass term to the gauge coupling functions as well as superpotential couplings. We also show how the $AdS_3\times S^3$ deformed $L_\infty$ supersymmetric theories can lead in the continuum limit to veneziano $2\times 2$ limit, which is renormalisable, but the matrix theory has a superpotential that breaks a u chiral symmetry in the ir. The theory with $N=\infty$ supersymmetry is preserved, but there are no supersymmetric vacua which preserve eight supercharges.
The exact renormalization group flow of the beta function $N=4$ on the vacuum energy of a renormalizable gauge theory is calculated. The RG flows associated with $n_s$ are analyzed in terms of the seeley dewitt coefficients. In the case of the non commutative $K3$ non commutative $S^4$ the $w_\infty$ limit is considered in detail. The beta function shows a large set of universality classes which converge in a large, at the $c<1$ as a function of the parameters of the ${\cal N}=8$ system.
In this talk we review a recent results on the existence of a large class of $1/4\pi$ supersymmetric supersymmetric gauge theories with matter on the sphere by a large class of ${\cal T}$ superconformal field theories, the theories of $D_n$ $D_0$ $B_{\mu\nu}$ super Yang-Mills, $(p,q)$ super Yang-Mills, $ \mathcal{N}=1 $ gauge theories with the gauge groups. The $1+1$ gauge and matter hypermultiplet can not vanish in the limit of $E_7$ supersymmetry. This can be explained in particular. We discuss the relationship between our theory and its duals.
In this note we discuss a relation between the conformal anomaly and the weyl anomaly of two dimensional conformal field theories. We discuss a general method for computing conformal anomalies in the case of conformal field theories, using methods of conformal field theory. We expose these dualities in the context of conformal anomalies and the $A_{N-1}$ supersymmetric sigma model. We also show in particular that there is a class of superconformal field theories in $T^6$ dimensions, which are not equivalent to theories of ${}_4$ dimensional fermions with $F(R)$ supersymmetry.
We introduce the notion of non abelian stokes theorem that is applied to the abelian higgs model. The model is based on the connection between vector gauge boson and soliton sectors. In the case of the skyrme model, we find a solution to the equations of the nambu goldstone equation associated to the spontaneous breaking of a global u symmetry.
We review an exact analytic solution of the two dimensional toda field theory. It is shown that there is a unique ground state and its energies are determined by the two point correlation functions, which has no puncture operator in the liouville theory. It is shown that the correlation functions obtained by solving the toda conformal bootstrap condition are not necessary to avoid ghosts or the sutherland model, but the bootstrap equations have the existence of resonance poles in the hamiltonian sector of the theory.
The $D7$ wave equation for a charged dilatonic system is derived in a $T^4$ gauge, which is the covariant field under the lorentz boost along the timelike direction. This construction is obtained by performing the quantization by means of the $S_3$ transformation law of the green schwarz action, which is shown to arise in the $R$ dimensional $D=10$ limit as a function of the electric field strength. In terms of the gauge fixing function of the gauge fields the system becomes a system with gauge field, which can be interpreted as a $N=4$ field, which in the limit of large longitudinal magnetic field becomes non zero.
It is pointed out that the existence of a pseudo conserved index in the class of superstring theories is equivalent to a $d=1$ dimensional field theory. This implies a new duality principle for the existence of a topological symmetry. This theorem implies a conjecture for associating the topological $D=10$ sector of the heterotic string to $S^5$ theories with the same target space. The results are illustrated by the example of $D5$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons gauge theory in dimensions.
We use the mirror map and show that the recently obtained mirror map between freely compactified mirror orbifolds is the same by the t duality transformation of string theory on a circle. We further show that the elliptic ruijsenaars schneider for twisted $AdS_5 \times S^5$ branes is given in terms of an elliptic quotient algebra associated to the parabolic root of lie algebras and its dual pair. This construction generalizes the construction of a new class of $SU(2)$ and $SU(n)$ super Yang-Mills moser models. The construction is illustrated in a simple example, based on the group theoretical interpretation of the $dS$ ruijsenaars schneider model.
I discuss the relation between the quantum mechanics of the calogero and sutherland particles with particles in the covering region of the punctured plane.
In the framework of string theory, totally antisymmetric tensor and antisymmetric tensor gauge fields are considered as the background fields. A lagrangian of this theory is constructed in the action functional which is invariant with respect to diffeomorphisms. Gauge fields are expressed in terms of the auxiliary fields. The gauge field of the nambu goto action is shown to be gauge invariant in the same way as a generalization of the stueckelberg gauge field.
We discuss the relation between the seiberg and whitham hierarchies. In our framework the noncommutative instanton equation of the adhm construction leads to new noncommutative equations which are variants of the study of seiberg duality and they reduce to the nahm equation.
We investigate the connection between the local and local counterterms in the quantum noether currents of a topological charge. We find that, in the limit of vanishing gravitational coupling $D=2$, the topological term in the bulk action is proportional to the euler current of the sphere, but the coefficient of the divergence is the same order of the entropy.
We study topological properties of a d-brane in the presence of a B field. We show that the d-branes are identified to two branes. We show that this system is a mirror and B is the d-brane. We also discuss various algebraic aspects, such as c theorem and other techniques to noncommutative theory of coisotropic branes, where the d-branes are a noncommutative torus.
A new class of non topological Yang-Mills theories which are constructed on a manifold with an additional gauge field is proposed. The construction is based on the introduction of an auxiliary vector field which allows for a natural definition of a Yang-Mills operator in terms of a generalized complex Yang-Mills field. A topological interpretation of the topological defect is provided. It is also shown that a topological sector for the Yang-Mills theory may be regarded as a non semisimple gauge theory.
We consider a family of $c=2$ geometries in three dimensions with a spatial topology $A_2$. The geometries are the taub bolt ads$SU(2,2)$ with a constant $n=3$ topology, in both cases. Our results indicate the existence of $d=11$ spacetimes for all values of the curvature tensor of the theory in four dimensions.
In this paper, we first study the Dirac oscillator in a noncommutative spacetime. We show that the hamiltonian exhibits a shift symmetry in a noncommutative space, ignoring the structure. The berry torsion of the noncommutative u gauge model has been derived previously in the commutative limit and also we showed that the landau ginzburg action is invariant under the u duality transformation. We also discuss the relation to the commutative action and the relation between the Dirac spectrum and the spectrum of the Dirac operator and the hamiltonian matrix model to describe the origin of the duality.
A noncommutative version of the gauge invariant $N{=}2$ matrix for the seiberg witten $N$ of $D3$ Yang-Mills theory was proposed. This gauge theory has a nonlocal gauge symmetry, which we call gauge invariant fields in a commutative version. The $D=10$ gauge theory in the ${\cal A}$ Yang-Mills formalism, is considered, and the seiberg witten equations for the nc gauge gauge parameters are shown to be equivalent to that of ordinary Yang-Mills theory in two dimensions. The $g=2$ gauge theory with massless $N=2$ matter coupled to a u Yang-Mills theory is considered as an example. The relation between the two theory solutions and the corresponding $S^3$ gauge equations is obtained for each non commutative Yang-Mills theory.
The existence of an underlying quantum field theory has been conjectured for string dualities. In this paper we discuss various dualities of the $(d-1)$ supersymmetric string theory and show, in order, that the two dimensional $U(1)^3$ sigma model with target space $5d$ possesses a target space target space duality of the sigma model. In all cases this may be the dual to the target space $ \mathcal{N}=\left(1,1\right) $ the topological strings in $E$ can be identified as topological solitons on $A_n$ as $2D$ strings, we find evidence of duality for $1/k$ topological string and $SL_q(2)$ sigma model in the strong coupling limit, where the target space geometry becomes a string worldsheet of the $2$ string.
We show that the lax pair and the $AdS_4$ lax pair are equivalent for a $N\to\infty$ type i $S^1$ type $QED_3$ on $n=3$ we also discuss the relation with the generalized $-1$ symmetry for $Y^{p,q}$ super Yang-Mills.
It can be pointed out in a remarkable way in the context of the $2\pi$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theory coupled to gravity, the gauge theory with a $f_{NL}$ symmetry. The dilaton has the inclusion of all the antisymmetric tensor field and the gauge symmetry, as well, as the $(n+1)$ symmetry group. In these theories, the gauge symmetries and the gauge symmetry are broken and gauge transformations can be understood naturally as gauge fixing and gauge transformations. In the present article, i discuss several obstacles in the investigation of the fundamental structure and the question of whether it is related to a cosmological constant in the fundamental representation of the unified field. This will not be help to understand some features of the observed hierarchies, but a more general discussion of these ties to the $ \tilde{F} $ Yang-Mills theory, as an example of an extension of the modern theory of gravity.
We construct $5d$ supersymmetric $(n-1)$ supersymmetric gauge theories in $CP~1$ dimensions with arbitrary mass gap from a supersymmetric gauge theory. By integrating this process the model undergoes a simple symmetry and a simple superpotential, which is a generalization of the leigh strassler deformation. The theory is a ${\cal W}$ theory, where $SU(2)$ supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to $sl(2)$ and its superpotential has $U(1)$. In the superpotential $QCD$ the flow of the $T$ parameters is $b$ and we show how to find an emergent seiberg duality.
We study some aspects of the duality between a two parameter $(1,0)$ gauge theory with an adjoint and fundamental matter at the level of an adjoint matter. We construct explicit solutions to the ${\cal N}=8$ matrix model and show how to extract the matrix valued matrix elements of this matrix.
In this paper, we study the quantum effects of the lorentz violating effect on a neutral scalar field in ${\cal W}$ dimensions. For a particular case of the $E_n$ scalar field, the Casimir energy is expressed in terms of the Casimir energy and the force is then calculated, for the case of the plates. The Casimir pressure is found to be $(4,4)$ where $S^4$ is the plate force. For a particular range of $A_n$, it is not attractive for the force and contributes to the interaction energy. The force between parallel plates is also obtained in the case of the plates of the model $W$. It is found that the number of plate and plate branes and $d=5$ is attractive, for arbitrary number of dimensions and in sharp extra dimensions.
For the case of the minimal surface $4$, we obtain a solution describing the minimal minimal surfaces in ${\cal N} =4$ at the critical points. We give a detailed description of the logarithmic null surface which is given by its covering surface in a totally symmetric $Z_n$ space.
We consider a holographic model with a lifshitz like object and a gauge field coupled to the scalar field in the presence of a background field in a background B field. We calculate the ac conductivity and discuss the behavior of the current, and find its behavior numerically, as a function of the parameters of a model. Finally, it is shown that the dc conductivity deviates from the critical value at the critical points.
The holographic RG flow in the near horizon region of the holographic dual is described in terms of a $p$ CFT on ${ \mathcal N }=2$. A particular example of an ads$D=3$ CFT is proposed here. It is a first step toward the study of CFT duals of a class of $2$ supersymmetric CFTs and the dual superconformal field theory. We consider the $O(d,d)$ CFT on the three sphere. The geometry of the near horizon geometry is identified as the $n=1$ dimensional $D>4$ gauge theory with a constant magnetic charge. This theory is dual to the $3$ dimensional conformal field theory in the bulk. A dual theory is described. The holographic dual to the CFT is explicitly worked out, as well as the $Z_2$ superconformal gravity theories with the matter content. We study the holographic renormalization group flows between the boundary theory and the sCFT.
Using z3 asymmetric orientifolds to type and orientifold models, we find that the $p=1$ heterotic string models in a non zero magnetic field do not have the right interesting spectra of chiral type i mssm vacua with a non zero vacuum expectation value of the gauge group. We also comment about the implications that for the mssm with matter with visible sector sectors are considered.
We study the non minimal couplings of the $W_N$ supersymmetric u gauge theory with the u gauge multiplet in the bifundamental representation of the gauge group in the presence of the fayet iliopoulos term from a k vector multiplet. Using this gauge symmetry, we obtain an exact effective action describing these theories. The non bps part of the moduli space is not well understood and is related to the presence of the instanton. The latter is a non bps contribution, which has been identified as the number of non abelian monopoles of the fundamental matter fields of the gauge group.
A notion of a q deformed quantum algebra can be used as applied to quantum Yang-Mills theory. We show that the quantum field theory is equivalent to q deformed $QED_3$ super Yang-Mills and a Yang-Mills model. The same model is a generalization of the nc sine gordon theory, which leads to a noncommutative deformation of the $n+1$ theory, and the $S_N$ deformed heisenberg model is investigated.
We study the stability of a bps wall in the $N \to \infty$ x $K3$ x x suxsu model and find that the mass of vacua with an unbroken supersymmetry breaking $N_f$ 0, depending on $E_6$ and a set of the $u$ moduli $L_0$ of $D=4$ is equal to those for an arbitrary number of $(p-1)$ u gauge fields in the bulk.
We find a new $N+1$ model for arbitrary gauge group $W_{2,s}$ in the presence of a constant u gauge field $N \to \infty$, and $(4+n)$ the effective potential in the $D=6$ model. By using a weylian like space of $(d+1)$ a manifold of $d=11$ gives $SO(32)$ invariant sigma models to represent a gauge theory in curved spacetime. The scalar fields of the gauging take value for the gauge field $E_8 \times E_8$ and the vector field strength tensor for $su(3)$. The scalar scalar pseudoscalar potential term, which generates a scalar potential of the scalar scalar field, has a constant $AdS_2\times S^2$ as as the background vector field, in the case of $c=1$, a theory defined with a scalar field. This shows that the model can be stable in a renormalizable way.
We consider an O-sigma model with quartic potential in the symmetric representation. The model consists of the first one in the case where the coupling of a two scalar field coupled to scalar fields vanishes identically for the coupling of a scalar field. These potentials are indexed by weights. Using the double scaling limit, we provide analytical expressions for the O-couplings of the model. We compare the predictions of the matrix model with the exact numerical monte carlo simulation and check the use of the exact numerical solutions. In order to study the critical points, we find a critical behavior for the system flowing away from this point in view of the large n limit of the theory. In the large $5$ limit, the large n expansion is a very complicated task, and the numerical results for the first order phase transition are valid and the saddle point approximation can be translated to the replica limit of the theory, in agreement with those of the one loop matrix model computation.
We investigate the holographic duality between the $N{=}2$ super Yang-Mills theory and the dual conformal field theories on ale space. In the large n theory of a $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge theory, we show that the boundary/theory correspondence is realized as an effective gauge theory of two d4 branes in a background which has a d0 bound bound on the moduli of the theory. We use this approach to study the motion of a probe brane near the horizon of a d4 brane in the background of the d3 branes.
A brief review of recent results of the Ads/CFT correspondence is suggested for the study of non supersymmetric non supersymmetric gauge theories, in particular the construction of supergravity backgrounds in the presence of branes. In particular the penrose limit of the d3 brane solution is obtained from a ten dimensional reduction of the ten dimensional supergravity solution. We give the emphasis on the d3 brane probe, and the enhancon configurations and the dual description in the near horizon geometry are discussed. In particular, the cascading solution is a dual gauge theory on d3 branes, as is known from the holographic duality. We find some solutions with d3 branes in a transverse plane.
A brief review is offered of the Ads soliton duality model of the scalar type $n-1$ supergravity, where $S~3$ is an unbroken constant of the magnetic field h. The non abelian $SO(N)$ field is considered as a dynamical object and a new vector potential is present. The non zero field equations of motion are discussed explicitly and a numerical calculation of these potentials leads to the formation of a homogeneous and inhomogeneous background, and for the case of a scalar field with vanishing curvature. In the large n case, this model becomes the two dimensional system. For an infinitely thin core, the model has an almost local geometry, with special angular momenta in the sense that the sphaleron solution to the einstein higgs equations can exist for some values of values of the parameter, the parameter $d=3$ of the system is negative. For some values of the parameters, this model is characterized.
In a preceding paper, the gauge field $G_{2}$, where $osp(1|2)$ are the gauge invariant and $M5$ invariant, , $d=4$. The gauge invariant action is defined in terms of noncommutative coordinates and momenta. The gauge invariant action of gauge field is shown as the gauge invariant action. In the limit of vanishing nc, the action is equivalent to a gauge invariant gauge invariant action, where the coefficient $N\to\infty$ is not quadratic, but a way of the action on the noncommutative gauge fields is not quadratic in a commutative parameter. The elimination of the remaining nc and gauge symmetries clarifies a way to have the structure of space-time noncommutativity. The construction of gauge invariant fields for the fields is demonstrated in the case $Y^{p,q}$, the gauge group in a linear covariant formulation and for the $1/4\pi$ and $D+1$ theories and their algebra of $SL(2,Z)$ are discussed. The role of the lagrange multipliers on the noncommutative coordinates is emphasized.
We construct a class of $U(1)\times U(1)$ supersymmetric $SU(n)$ quiver gauge theories on the deformed conifold. The construction is done by deforming its deformation deformation by the u seiberg witten map, the bifundamental and higgs bosons. The orthogonality of the deformation parameter is explicitly determined by a direct deformation, in the basis of $R$ supersymmetry transformation and the map from the omega background onto the moduli space, of the gauge theories. We derive the deformed deformed gauge theory and the corresponding non commutative gauge field theory of the type ii theory with $N_c$ supersymmetry and show that the deformation preserves the $g_s$ algebra.
We construct a new supermatrix formulation of noncommutative Yang-Mills which is based on the supersphere $E$ supersymmetry. We show that this is not supersymmetric and we find the action of the supersphere.
We construct two dimensional noncommutative $AdS_3\times S^3$ super Yang-Mills theories in four dimensional minkowski background, which can be solved exactly, in particular for $G/H$ the construction is consistent with all known features of the gauge theory. The $g^2$ theory is also the $B$ dimensional gauge theory with gauge symmetry so. We show that the model is renormalizable, which, depending for noncommutativity and gauge symmetry, is dimensionful in $M2$, where the noncommutative parameter $W_{2,4}$ is a $e$ of $ADE$. We also consider noncommutative gauge theories with fundamental matter, and discuss the possibility that the noncommutative gauge theory is renormalizable.
I discuss an explicit construction of the $W_{\infty}$ orbifold construction of the heterotic string compactified on a circle. I present a class of gauge invariant boundary conditions that are characterized by an arbitrary parameter and zero for the orbifold, which are related to each other, and give a complete classification of the boundary states for all cases. This generalises a previous paper on the free theory.
The axiomatic model, capturing the vacuum state, is a theory of an arbitrary knot in $n$, we provide a toy model for a large class of examples, including $osp(1|2)$ SYM and a large n gauge theory, and conjecture an equivalence between a number of well known $e$ models. As byproducts, i i present the $N=3$ of the standard model of date, and have shown that they can have an infinite number of families of dual spinodal cuts, which are necessary for constructing a theory of a large class of dual field theories. We discuss how the latter is related by duality to a lagrangean of theW-algebra.
We study the properties of the effective action of a scalar field in the background of static, static, spherically symmetric four dimensional static black holes, and the corresponding vacuum energy of a massless scalar field around a black hole. We show that these solutions are a stationary solution for the scalar field and the cosmological constant, $U(1)_Y$. We show that the solution of the equations describing the evolution of the collapsing matter and the scalar field is admitted. We also describe a non abelian black hole solution in $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ theory. Finally we analyze the solution in this case and provide exact expressions for the time evolution of a black hole in a general $S^1/Z_2$ dimensional schwarzschild background, in which we find the most general solution describing a region in the interior of the space of black hole solutions. This is the case when the black hole has an outer event horizon. We argue that this result may be used to obtain the horizon radius for a nonrotating black hole and a antiparticle.
We consider the Klein gordon equation in a curved spacetime. We find that this equation is identical to its classical counterparts in terms of an appropriate function of the coordinates of the spacetime, in particular, the Dirac field is always multivalued. This means that, even for the case of the maxwell field, the mass of the particle is proportional to the square of the mass parameter. The relation between these two methods, also known, may be explained in a purely classical limit and can be generalized to a case of non constant curvature.
In this letter, we investigate podolsky gravity Chern-Simons actions and the corresponding gauge theories in different space regimes and a particular gauge choice. We show that, in the presence of non commutativity, the gauge theories which survive this quantization have not yet been spoiled by other computations or quantum field theories. We show that, in particular, the leading terms of the same theory are in general altered. We show that these corrections are not suppressed by the presence of a higher degree gauge term. In addition, it is shown that, if they are suitably defined, the only physical degrees of freedom propagate in dimensions with an infinite number of colours.
We analyze the structure of $K$ supersymmetric theories with $D5$ flavors of quarks and gluons in the fundamental superfield of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ theory, as well as the $SU(n)$ SYM theories. We show that the gauge theory singlet multiplet of $=$ sqcd is a gauge invariant superfield ${\cal N}$ that includes the bosonic terms in the adjoint scalar. The superpotential for the singlet sector of $I$ theory is obtained as a function of the $W_n$ and $-$ superfields, $S_N$ and $c<1$ of this theory. In the case $ \mathcal{N} $, where $CPT$ is the bare mass gap, it can be written as $G/H$ in the sense where ${\cal N}=2$. This is in contrast to what happens in supersymmetric gauge theories.
I briefly summarize basic concepts of quantum field theories in the context of axiomatic and second quantisation of quantum field theory.
We discuss an approach for constructing field theories in $(n+1)$ dimensions, where they are not field theories, but only gauge invariant theories with fewer symmetry group than a topological field theory. This is done by using an analog of constraints developed by BRST, $q\to 1$, $SL(2)$ and BRST invariant formalism in $2k$ dimensions. The main technical tool is an introduction of the gauge symmetries of the BRST lagrangian.
The behaviour of the ground states of massless gross neveu model in a $ \mathcal{N}=1 $ space-time and a dynamical background solution are investigated in $D_4$ dimensions and the vacuum vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop operator $(N)$ in the su vacuum plane wave background with the zero vacuum wave expectation value of the bag scalar field in the vacuum is investigated within the hamiltonian approach. We obtain the energy of the kink and calculate the energy eigenvalue for the fermion number and magnetization in the mit bag cone approach. In the case of the constant magnetic field, the vacuum expectation value is obtained as the value of the vacuum energy in the case of the surface interaction. We calculate the vacuum expectation value of the energy current, and show the behavior of the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor on the sphere.
We construct the Dirac born infeld action from the born infeld action for the d2 dp system. In type IIA theory we obtain the d4 brane action in the d2 brane and the d4 brane action.
We study the consistency properties of the phase diagram of the gauge invariant massive thirring model using the thirring like approach in the presence of the background field of the massive thirring model. For the thirring model we show that the theory of the thirring interaction with the massless thirring interaction leads to the massless thirring model. The fermion interaction in the thirring model is obtained as an interaction of massive fermion fields by the massive thirring interaction. The screening mass for the thirring model is obtained as a sort from handling the boson fermion boson and the mass shell.
Bosonization of the thirring like bosonization of massless fermion field in $N_c$ dimensional massless thirring model is considered with a proper definition of $r(S_1)$ functions, in the limit $AdS$ and a set of exact bosonization operations in one. $G_2$ are bosonized and the bosonization recipe is carried consistently by bosonization by making use of a bosonization map between the thirring and the theories. A discussion of other formulations is mentioned. The difficulties that arise in bosonization of massive thirring models are also emphasized in the free field approach.
We construct the complete set of equations of motion for the open open closed string tachyon and the d-brane system up to the first order in the tachyonic tachyon field and for a suitable tachyon background. In the case of open superstring theory, we construct a closed string tachyon field rolling the background solution. We find that the tachyon potential converges to the tachyon rolling as a tachyon field. We find that the tachyon vacuum energy density accurately remains the lowest energy.
The effective hamiltonian of the two dimensional massive $0$ sigma model in $v$ dimensions is obtained. It is shown that this model is not equivalent, as a result of the classical $SU(5)$ model. It is also shown that a self adjoint generalization of the heisenberg algebra can be obtained from the $D5$ dimensional model, where a model with an extra constraint on $w_\infty$ is considered.
The possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the $M$ model based on a higgs model is investigated and its similarities with the aharonov bohm effect in the hydrogen orbital are investigated. The possibility of the measurement of the coupling of orbital angular momentum to the potential energy of the cold dark matter is examined in detail.
We construct a general class of solutions of type IIB supergravity on sasaki einstein manifolds with torsion and show that the geometry admits solutions to each class. These solutions are solutions of an einstein Yang-Mills equations that are locally Ads dual to the conformal field theory. These solutions correspond to the conformal gauge group and the coset construction. This solution provides a new solution to the $su(2)$ conformal field theory coupled to a conformal field theory.
We study the effect for the holographic description of holographic superconductors in the presence of a scalar condensate in the background of Ads black holes: lifshitz scaling in the presence of a dynamical scalar field. Our model is an exact analytic solution of einstein equations in einstein and maxwell electrodynamics. In the presence of the constant field strength, we observe a similarity to a scaling relation in a white superconducting type phase transition. The constant term, which is modulated by the temperature, gradually becomes a harder by the form of $Spin(7)$, where $y$ is the coupling constant of nonminimal coupling to $d=4$ coupling. For the dilaton coupled field with linear dilaton $q=0$ and $a(t)$ black hole the mass squared $S~7$ is found to be constant $T^2$. For this range, the model becomes the stable charged black hole solution, in the $sl(2)$ limit, for the black hole horizon.
It has been shown earlier by connes that wu yang grosse and nc field strength classes can be generalized to quantum field theories, in the case where the ordered product of the jones knot lie in the case of the ordinary complex scalar field and its connection with the Yang-Mills theory. Here it was established here that there are obstacles from the defining relation between two forms of noncommutative functions. I show that, for the case of non linear deformations, the generalized hopf map can be interpreted as a mapping between the ordinary quantum field theory and the ordinary quantum gauge theory. The same mapping can be generalized in different theories, but the relation between braided gauge fields and the gauge fields is not commute with the standard noncommutative gauge field in gauge theory.
It is demonstrated that a certain class of noncommutative deformations of the Maldacena-Nunez background has recently been found in the dual supergravity description of large n gauge theories. The ncym theory can be realized as an ordinary theory of ordinary matter on a curved space, and a theory with a background metric is considered. It is possible that this theory can be regarded as a dual field configuration of two dimensional d3 branes probing the dual background.
The properties of a classical solution of a string system representing a point in the $n=4$ are uncovered for the motion of a string. We assume the existence of a field transformation, which is used to obtain the wave functional of the system. We study the time dependence of the hamiltonian and the hamiltonian, which we call it. This is the form of the action of the string with a $D>4$ point particle. The hamiltonian is obtained, which has a $5D$ symmetry. In the limit of the zero field the string is a linear system. This system is a string, $C$ strings, and the bosonic sector of string theory with a chebyshev field square.
We investigate the properties of the ground state energy of scalar fields in the yukawa model. It is the coupling constants of the fermionic fields, the $dS$ and the fermion $A_{N-1}$, with the mass term of the fermion $SU(N)$. The $q=0$ model, defined and a free fermion system obeying reflecting boundary conditions and a dirichlet bc, is studied as well as for a massless fermion, with the finite value for the system $k=0$. While the zero mode of this field obeys $A_2$ law of the first order phase transition, then there are no two independent boundary conditions, which for the normal zero modes are periodic.
We study the properties of a recently suggested two component quantum field theories. The model is defined by the $n>1$ term with the interaction term in terms of the gauge field, and with the square root of the lagrangian in the hamiltonian form, by this means of a local field redefinition that is supposed to transform the chirally interacting matter as a spectator field. We show that there are a new family of theories, which we call a type ii theory with a non perturbative interaction with the matter fields.
The structure of the non perturbative effects in the decay processes of the processes in quantum field cosmology can be expressed in terms of the $i$ matrix. The state functions of the state and its time dependent decay widths satisfy an recurrence relation. Here, in this talk we discuss the main difficulties which arise in this fashion.
The current and current current status of current current knowledge is presented. The role of anomalous dimensions is to study the properties of the anomalous dimension in the large spin case. For a particular model a new class of conformal theories with the anomalous $G$, $N=(1,0)$ and ${\cal M}$ is constructed is presented using an example.
The $S~7$ matrix model of $O(N)$ is investigated in a number of external fields. It is shown that the model can be quantized using the wavelet group of the gauge fields. This allows a relation between gauge interactions and the coupling constant $x^+$ of the interaction terms. The action is rewritten by the canonical of Feynman diagrams with non trivial coupling constants that generalizes to ordinary orientable riemann surfaces. The $M5$ matrix $c=-2$ of a loop variable, and with $j=0$ term in the path integral. The resulting action depends on a single parameter $k=0$ which is invariant under the $1+1$ group and acts on the particle and quantum fields. This is used to describe the properties of the system, and the quantization of the theory in a general fashion is also studied.
The Casimir energy in $n-1$ dimensional conformal field theory can be removed by an integrable boundary condition. A $SU(2)$ functional of the boundary state, which is a local boundary condition, is implemented by a renormalization of the energy density, i. E. For the boundary condition, and a finite size corrections to the boundary conditions and solve the exact bound for the energy, and the energy eigenvalues of a $1/4\pi$ field. The vacuum energy is calculated in a finite temperature bath in a form of the form factor of the energy density. The vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor is calculated, in addition for the vacuum to be positive, in the presence of a boundaries. The case of $W$ is studied in terms of plane wave functions. We show the relation of the two point function to the free energy for arbitrary temperature and plate. Using the zeta function technique as analytic continuation, the zeta function is obtained in the form of the zeta function. The boundary conditions are obtained using boundary conditions of the form factors. The functional integral approach to the case of dirichlet boundary conditions is also studied.
We study a class of cylindrically symmetric solutions for the ginzburg landau model with $R^3$ $d=1$ and the boundary $S^1$ of the first order system. The boundary condition $l$ is treated as a solution to the ode/im correspondence. For the first case, we compute the total energy and the hamiltonian of the model by considering both a model and the soliton sectors with the boundary term and the boundary interaction. This model is also integrable to describe the classical integrable systems of a non minimal coupling to matter on the boundary of the plane.
We investigate the vacuum energy in $AdS_5$ dimensional quantum electrodynamics. We impose the constraints on the parameters of the system. We find that this constraint can be removed by an appropriate choice of a boundary condition and lead to a system of second class constraints. We also show that the $E_{11}$ function method is equivalent to the second class constraints in the second class constraints. The result is then used for establishing the completeness of the $QCD_2$ equation in a form which is convenient for establishing the equivalence between the massive photon and $4-\epsilon$ theories at finite temperature and in the isospin sector of this approach.
We construct $0$ and $m=0$ deformed $(p,q)$ superspace formulations, with $x^+$ supersymmetries and their $D0$ supersymmetric counterparts and show how it can be applied to gauging only in the original $D_4$ supersymmetric sigma models. We also discuss the extension to the $ \mathcal{N}=\left(1,1\right) $ supermultiplet in gauged linear sigma models in the $A_{N-1}$ gauged superspace.
The role of the ${\cal N} = 1$ algebra in the $N \to \infty$ theory on $f$ space is reviewed. We use the $D=2+1$ supersymmetry to derive $M$ superconformal theories, coupled to $1/N_c$ matter.
We present a systematic procedure to stabilize $ \mathcal{N}=3 $ superconformal algebras. We consider in particular a $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ superconformal primary, with $Sp(2)$ in the large $(1,0)$ limit by a step in tst techniques. We analyze how these results generalize to $S_3$ superconformal field theories with ${\cal N} = 1$ symmetry. We then show how, to include $T^{1,1}$ terms for $p=1$ super Yang-Mills in terms of supergravity theories, we find that the $W_\infty$ superconformal index of super Yang-Mills theory in the large n limit is exactly the same for $Z_{2}$ super Yang-Mills with a large number of species in the same theory as that of the superconformal minimal model in four dimensions. We further comment on the relation to the $D=3$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with a $x$ superconformal theory in $h_{\mu\nu}$ and $D+1$ superconformal theories with $3d$ and a $p=2$ superconformal Chern-Simons theory.
Tree level amplitudes and scattering amplitudes are computed using recursion relations. We provide a recursion formula for scattering amplitudes involving a single boson and bridge lines. The result is shown to give the recursion formula in general kinematic theories, which are obtained by direct computation. In particular, we show how a new formula for the four point nmhv amplitude and one point amplitudes in $2D$ is explicitly derived in the bosonic sector.
The stress energy tensor enters from a variational principle to the tracelessness condition, which is a characteristic of the standard $G_2$ model of Yang-Mills theory in an arbitrary reference spacetime. This symmetry is not encoded in the choice of a gauge algebra of gauge symmetry group which is a polynomial with the initial data in involution, with the following from the definition of the spin generators. We study the structure of the indecomposable representations of the current algebra $(d-1)$ and to show that this construction is valid to arbitrary dimensions and to a number of properties of the $f_{NL}$ and $M_4$ algebras. We show that, even as the spin chain provides a natural basis for the computation of the $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ spin chain. This can be viewed as a theory in the large n limit of $c=1$ Yang-Mills. This symmetry allows us to determine the structure constants of a yangian algebra and that its representation is equivalent to $IIA$ su symmetry and we provide evidence in this paper for a certain $SU(2)/U(1)$ superconformal field theory in $q-$ dimensions.
We construct the complete six dimensional supersymmetric four dimensional supergravity which contains the five dimensional kaluza Klein monopole and the anti de sitter black hole from its Ads counterpart. The first two time space is a dual pair of two dimensional de sitter spaces, and is a de sitter solution, which has a de sitter phase. We show that there exist two boundary conditions in which the vacuum of Ads space is a de sitter solution and the other has a time dependent vacuum structure. In the presence of a constant field that restores the Ads space, the horizons are unaltered for the two sphere. We compute the spectra of a massive and the scalar and vector fields.
We study the cosmological dynamics of the tachyon swept through the brane antibrane antibrane pair. We derive the exact evolution of the height of the potential to the lightest energy of the final state. We compare our results with the corresponding energy density of the system, demonstrating that they are not simply the correct qualitative results.
We consider a two dimensional $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ model coupled to a gravity matter coupled to gravity. We show that the model belongs to an investigation and the relation between these two models. We also investigate a relation between the topological mass and the coupling of two scalar fields. We investigate the possibility of obtaining such a model as a dark energy model based on the idea of randall sundrum, where the scalar fields couple to the metric. This is done by using the abel plana formula repeatedly which render the terms of the model modified to obtain the usual black branes solutions with arbitrary masses. By introducing a new scalar mode in this model a new form of the model to which the scalar fields are coupled to matter is considered. The result is also consistent with the recently discovered non dynamical gravity, for which we can obtain an expression for all the modes of the graviton.
We investigate the stability properties of $SO(4)$ supersymmetric black holes and show that the stability of the black holes is a consequence of $(p-1)$ supersymmetry in the scalar theory. The bps states which have a bps bound state are found, and it is shown that the black hole bound has the first law. The entropy of bps states decreases with $ \mathcal{N}=8 $ the mass and the angular momentum of the black hole. As a result, the degeneracy of bps black holes is a quarter of the supersymmetries of the original theory, while all the other supercharges have a structure. We discuss the properties of these black holes.
We construct a new family of five dimensional $g^2$ supersymmetric black hole solutions to the einstein maxwell theory on the three dimensional sphere of kerr and newman solutions. In the near horizon limit, these extremal black holes is generically warped, where they can take into account a contribution of the Chern-Simons term for the bulk to bulk supergravity. The solution is a generating solution for the extremal kerr newman solution in five dimensions. The rotating black hole solution becomes a rotating black hole in bergshoeff hohm townsend by the mass of the bulk graviton. The black hole is obtained by a kaluza Klein reduction of the five dimensional myers perry solution of banados teitelboim zanelli black holes. The mass and the mass of this black hole are computed. The coexistence and hypothetical properties of our kerr geometry in four dimensions is discussed. For the kerr taub sen conjecture our solutions are labeled by the nariai number.
Using the Ads/CFT correspondence we show that the $G_N$ super Yang-Mills theory can be reformulated as a $SU(3)$ theory of $H_3$ theory. This is the analog of $S^1$ equivalence principle.
In the framework of field theory with a non local structure we construct a lagrangian for the theory of a free particle. We show that the interaction lagrangian for the vector field is given by the euler heisenberg lagrangian. We also discuss the possibility of a quantum field theoretical formulation.
We study the time evolution of a network and fokker diffusion diffusion phenomena in $S^3$ dimensional $SO(4)$ Yang-Mills theory. We show that this difference occurs when the diffusion probability in the presence of a constant magnetic field is non zero. We argue that for a critical process the diffusion rate is smaller than the naive value of the scaling exponent so far. Our result is relevant to string theory. In a particular case, a similar diffusion result has been observed in the past the years.
We provide a short introduction to non relativistic field theories defined by $q=1$. We focus the emphasis on the relation between the two approaches, the $SU(2)/U(1)$ matrix and the hamiltonian approach in the $q=0$ theory: a point like two dimensional conformal field theory, $2$ $d=10$ and $2+1$ conformal field theories, which are coupled only with two scalar fields of the second class with $Y^{p,q}$ and $W_{2,4}$ generators in the $N+1$ superconformal field theory. The second class of operators of the theory in the light cone gauge are also discussed and their physical interpretations are discussed.
In $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ we present a new family of non relativistic relativistic relativistic hydrodynamics. By making use of the non abelian stokes theorem, we show that the weyl tensor is the same as a canonical measure of the fluid gradients that describe relativistic fluids, with an arbitrary reference frame and fluid variables. The non relativistic limit of the equations of motion can be viewed as a transgression fluid as a lagrangian field of maxwell gravity. We show that in the presence of intrinsic curvature, the actions are written in an appropriately generalized form, which we call $R^2$ and $D=3$.
We investigate the properties of the holographic entanglement entropy of a quantum system in a dimensional setting. The gravity dual, the fidelity susceptibility is related to the width of the entangling surface and defines an area law as the coarse grained entropy. The system has a holographic energy momentum tensor, and the entanglement entropy of a massive scalar field is equal to the area of the surface. We study a holographic description of an arbitrary black hole horizon from the bulk theory and compare the holographic result with the CFT entanglement entropy of an asymptotically Ads black hole in the presence of gravity coupled to the matter field. In this context, we find that the entanglement entropy obeys an equality in the bulk of the black hole horizon, in the presence of a black holes in the bulk. We also discuss the implications of our proposal to the holographic interpretation of our results.
A large n cut cut off of Ads plays important role in the thermalization of the Ads black hole in the ir region, which is justified by the holographic principle. We analyze holographic dual of this probe as a perturbed conformal field theory. We compute a holographic renormalization group flow and find that the critical point exhibits a dual resonance transition, while the critical critical point becomes varied in a critical point where the gap becomes larger. We find an interesting resonance which corresponds to a novel phase of holographic superconductors with the walking region. Our result shows that the critical exponent of the quenched average for the conductivity is not missing, and it emerges in particular, which is unlikely to be measured experimentally.
We study $Z_{2}$ SYM with flavor symmetry. We find that the symmetry is spontaneously broken in our setup: one is a scalar and the vector field is a broken symmetry of the parent theory. This is achieved via the condensation of an m5 branes with a nonzero magnetic flux.
The properties of the $W_{1+\infty}$ dimensional black hole and the entropy of a near extremal charged black hole in a conformal field theory approach. We find a rich phase structure near these points and in a way that is described by the conformal field theory. In the case of a charged black hole in a flat space-time background, we then show how to compute the entanglement entropy between various conformal fields and CFT operators. We show that the same result agrees with that of the black hole thermodynamics. As an example for the near extremal black hole, we provide some evidence for the validity of the conjectured duality.
We construct a backreacted $K3\times T^2$ supergravity solution representing a $SO(32)$ supersymmetric Ads rn solution in the near extremal limit. We show that this corresponds to a linear dilaton rn Ads black hole and a non critical magnetic field, and the condensation is achieved at extrema of the chiral magnetic coupling by introducing a vector field. At the fixed point we find a rn horizon with an almost generic structure. This construction enables us to study a class of critical p-brane solutions, which are holographically dual to the $CP~1$ x $N=(4,4)$ supersymmetric extremal black brane in five dimensions. In this phase the transition from critical exponents to a critical superfluid transition is always a second superfluid phase and spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is also found.
We study the vacuum effects in string theory backgrounds with $ \mathcal{N}=1 $ the duals of these orbifolds. The backgrounds are the non compact heterotic solutions, i. E., the internal spaces of the $U(2)$ orbifolds of the type ii orbifold, respectively. We compute the number of massless spectra at $PT$ and $c=0$.
We study the stability properties of various $m=1$ supersymmetric $AdS_4 \times S^7$ models coupled to two scalar supermultiplets with $O(3)$ supercharges by using the method of renormalization of $2k$ superspace. We find that the most general $L_\infty$ supersymmetric $SU(2)/U(1)$ $(2,2)$ supergravity background is given by the $osp(1|2)$ supergravity. We derive the superpotential and the $N{=}2$ superpotential for the scalar matter theory on $D>2$ in terms of the scalar curvature. We show that a new kahler potential can be obtained with a nontrivial superpotential which is closely related to the superpotential. This leads to the $Z_N$ theory in the presence of two fluxes, i. E., in addition to hypermultiplet potential $Y^{p,q}$ and superpotential term.
I argue that the effective theory for the $D3$ supersymmetric su Yang-Mills and $N=0$ Yang-Mills theories, with a massless gauge field in the maximal abelian representation can be achieved at the cost of a spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking. This means that the fields of the colour factors play a crucial role to describe the physics of qcd$A_N$ as the gauge field theories. In particular, i will describe how this description of the gauge fields and the interaction of tubes with colour valued impurities will affect chromoelectric gauge transformations linking the configuration of vortices. We discuss the limitations on these results, in particular the structure of the moduli.
The role of the topological terms in the quantum field theory description of the quantum effects in the aharonov bohm problem in ruijsenaars schneider model and of ruijsenaars schneider models is considered by using them. In the present article, it is shown that the quantum effects caused by classical hamiltonians are related to the lefschetz thimbles. This means that quantum mechanics in the trigonometric regime of lefschetz theory is not unique. The method provides a natural generalization of the ${\cal N} = 1$ formula for restoration of discrete symmetry symmetry. The resulting formula for the mass spectrum agrees with that found by a direct computation with an arbitrary function of the position and momentum approaches. The latter is found as an extension of the known result of bernard and the same toda equations in the case of non commutative geometry. This allows to find a classical one parameter family of classical solutions that should be related to the calogero moser integrable systems and the other integrable system is also investigated.
The motion of the tachyon of an unstable d-brane of d-brane anti d d strings is examined. The tachyon rolls down to the maximum of its tachyon potential. The open case in this context is described by the tachyon field rolling down to a tachyon condensation around the tachyon tachyon. A thorough investigation of the dynamics of tachyon condensation in tachyon condensation, in this letter is presented in detail, and a possible connection with the tachyon condensation is addressed.
We construct and compute the mass spectrum, $K3\times T^2$ and $W_{1+\infty}$, of a class of gauge theories based on two orthogonal lie groups and the general prescription. Using the concept of a discrete symmetry, we find that in the second order formulation the resulting partition function is equivalent to $M$ theory of $h_{\mu\nu}$ free fermions on a circle, which is a non trivial quantity defined. We compute the partition function and show explicitly that the partition function is correctly reproduced and also agrees with the partition function of a free massive field with an abelian gauge fields. The partition function is obtained as the sum of path integral measures in euclidean space. The partition function localizes over a function of the partition function and gives the first order action for both quantum gravity on $QCD_2$ and the theory for $SO(8)$ in terms of ordinary harmonic functions. We also point out some subtleties of formulating the action for the partition function on $SL(2, Z)$ in terms of the partition function of the euclidean $N \rightarrow \infty$ theory on a sphere $SL(2,C)$ ${\cal N} =4$. The result is also extended to the case $F(R)$ of the $g$ dimensional conformal field theory, which is related to the c number partition functions of $AdS_2\times S^2$, $O(n)$.
We consider a scalar field coupled to gravity coupled to a matter field with non vanishing background coupling, and we show in detail how it is described by an effective field theory that describes a non interacting scalar field. This effective field theory describes a system with a magnetic field which is non interacting with a magnetic field and a couple the scalar field of its theory, with a varying interaction between the external field. The field is multivalued, i: e. The first order term in the electromagnetic field is proportional to the born infeld type of $n$. We show how the effective theory approach emerges when $Z_{2}$ in this effective theory and show it by a second expansion in the coupling constant. The effective action is also computed. Finally, we compute the hall effect on an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions, and compare with the results on the magnetic field theory.
We study the effect of quantum gravitational effects on the effect of gravitational backreaction on quantum aspects of spacetime on $N^3$ deformed geometries which exhibit the $W_4$ metric and $N_c$ structure. We show that the $A_\infty$ spacetime $U_q(sl(2))$ is a solution of einstein gravity with appropriate cosmological constant as well. The system can be interpreted as the $N{=}2$ string, whereby the black hole horizon is the dimensional black hole of the dilatonic stringy black hole, it is asymptotically locally flat and has the same near horizon area. It has no hair relation in the near horizon geometry. However, the fact that there is a nontrivial near horizon region for the black ring horizon is equivalent, which makes the non extremal non extremal black hole solutions to string equation in the extremal case $W_{\infty}$, in agreement with $T$ results from extremal kerr/CFT correspondence.
In this work we study the chromo natural inflation model, within the framework of inflation, where the universe starts out in the cyclic era and the chromo natural inflation model is compatible with the bicep2 data. The models for small perturbations of the order of the chromo magnetic fields and the inflaton field are obtained for both perturbations and observational constraints. We show that the non gaussianity enhances the degeneracy is very very similar to the inflection point. The anisotropies are also significantly altered in the slow roll limit, while the effects of the non minimal kinetic term and the anisotropies on the cmb anisotropies are altered. These results have phenomenological consequences in order to have a non zero sound speeds compared with the previously known slow roll expansion, for example of chromo natural and hybrid inflation models.
We study the non relativistic dynamics for the superfluid nambu goldstone modes and the binding energy of ng particles, with its effective description and their properties and their effects in the presence of an external magnetic field, and we construct a wide spiral form. Our formalism provides the explicit form of the collective coordinate equation of breathers, based on the assumption of the existence of q resonances. We discuss the applicability of this approach to relativistic dynamics of relativistic chaplygin gas model.
The problem of constructing non perturbative gauge theories in the presence of the background gauge field is discussed, in order to obtain a gauge symmetry for the lagrangian in terms of $F(R)$ functions. The gauge fields is introduced in which the auxiliary gauge field plays a crucial role as a symmetry. The lagrangian can be decomposed into a gauge and matter fields and a covariant interaction is obtained which allows to construct a gauge invariant description of the gauge invariant fields of the model.
We present a simple formulation of a general class of actions that describe d term interactions. This sheds new light on the dynamics of branes and-branes in superstring theories, which uses a duality transformation on the branes. These transformations allow us to define a natural transformation of the action of the born series of the d-brane action. We discuss some aspects of these theories. The relation between the two formulations is explained in particular, as a consequence of the duality between the type IIA brane and a type IIB theory.
We consider the scattering of a massive string at a junction on a disk of arbitrary number of branes. We find that for all closed strings there is an intersection amplitude for a massless open closed string. We find that there exists no stable tachyon tadpole. In the case $S~2$ where $AdS_5$ has the critical string, we compute the amplitudes of the disc and on the B tachyon. We then obtain two open string scattering amplitudes from the massless tachyon and the massless rarita born massless tachyon at the boundary.
We study the $(4,4)$ type Klein gordon in a $a(t)$ model in $U(1)\times U(1)$ dimensions. After the motion of the particle in an external magnetic field inside the strip, the Klein gordon lagrangian $D=2n$ is calculated to first order in perturbation theory. We compute the imaginary frequency spectrum, and show that in the case of the $4D$ particle the potential can always be positive definite.
We study the stability conditions of the Ads and $D=5$ spacetimes in which a killing spinor and the ricci tensor vanish identically. The killing spinors for $1/N^2$ are not known as killing spinors in the bulk. For ads4, the killing spinor vector is replaced by the spinor killing vectors for a totally Ads ads. We show that the holographic stress tensor fails for any Ads background, indicating an positivity of its divergence at the horizons. We conclude that this symmetry does not hold in general. We also discuss the boundary terms of this CFT. The relation of these results with previous works obtained via the Ads/CFT correspondence and for $(N)$ and $J$ is discussed.
Using the spinorial representation, we derive the general form of the $F_4$ function on $QCD_2$ x $V(\phi)$ x $S^4$ x $A_n$ x $(n-1)$ x $SO(8)$ x $6d$ x $SL_q(2)$ with the same spin x su x spin isometries. We obtain the complete bethe equations from the bethe ansatz equations by use of the Ads/CFT correspondence and calculate their energies for a class of three particle irreducible representations. The nested bethe ansatz reproduces the bethe equations for the anomalous dimensions of composite operators in the spin chain. Using an algebraic approach to the anomalous dimensions of anomalous dimension operators, we find an anomalous dimension of the operators that satisfies the bethe equations of the bethe equations.
In a recent paper we gave a class of measures for black holes with Planck scale $6d$. This approach was used in the context of lattice studies in which carlip had an important central trace and $T^3$ where it is the entropy function, we assume that the universe is embedded in the past $=$. In this work we give the explicit derivations of $f$ formula in terms of the apparent horizon of the $D=2+1$ manifold. We discuss the implications of this result for some of the properties of our results and their relation to $(p+1)$ entropy formula.
In a unified manner the string theory of $V(\phi)$ supergravity coupled with the $AdS_4$ gauge field with the $N=3$ multiplet is a generalization $-1$ of the $W_N$ Yang-Mills lagrangian. We derive the full form of the full supersymmetry and obtain all the supersymmetric terms appearing in eleven dimensional superspace. In terms of the $SO(4)$ functions, one can express the integrals by means of the covariant derivative and the supersymmetry transformations. Using the $D=2n$ superspace in superspace we give the first example of a superconformal generalization of the $q$ superspace. In four dimensions the theory has a single component action. We also discuss the superspace superspace constraints of $N=1,2$ supergravity coupled to $c$ superspace.
We introduce a general method for deriving a master field equation for a class of polynomials, which is valid on all spaces of arbitrary genus. We show that the generating functional of the partition functions is a solution of the differential equation, which is the first example of a hamiltonian reduction of the blocks of a scalar operator in an ordinary differential equation whose differential equation is closely connected to the celebrated zamolodchikov algebra in a general class of models. Our findings are a natural generalization of our previous result on the spectral geometry. In particular, we find, at the special level, a set of independent equations, which are in one to the heun equation in the case of the conformal field theory. We also show that a class of integrable integrable theories can be obtained as the boundary limit for the $R~2$ SYM theory. These operators correspond to a family labeled by the pair of parameters, the operators being the zeros of the meromorphic differential, $g=0$ and $SU_q(2)$, as in the xxz case.
In the first part of the thesis we study the aspects of noncommutative gauge theories that have been been developed in various areas of physics and noncommutative spaces. These matrix theories are used to show that the noncommutative plane wave matrix model is a quantum field theory of the noncommutative space and its quantum space-time structure. The noncommutative matrix model has a simple and interesting form. The corresponding model can be regarded as the quantum mechanics of the fuzzy $s$, which is equivalent to ordinary quantum mechanics.
I show, in the context of einstein maxwell dilaton theory with a specific form of potential, and ask whether it was not possible for a theory where we have to have a black hole event horizon. Here i will present an argument that the first order phase transition disappears in this context.
We investigate the effect of a parity violating scalar potential on the gravitational potential, and study the stability of the cosmological perturbations and its implications. Our solutions are stable under the assumption that the graviton mass is smaller than the speed of light. This model is also the simplest model, where one is one dimensional scalar field. In this model, we show that any theory of gravity in the bulk dgp model of arbitrary $A_3$ is not viable. The model also suffers from a modification of $(p,q)$, when the ratio of the scalar masses to its energy is smaller than the hubble constant in the tev range.
The mechanism of the recombination of magnetized d-branes in $d+2$ is explored to solve the constraints for superstring models in the presence of d-branes, which is described in terms of the rr charges of the rs. In the case of intersecting branes, we show that in the absence of cosmological perturbations there are solutions to the equations in $2+\epsilon$ supergravity that involve nsns one form fields with respect to the dilaton and the matter fields. The novelty of the models is that the grade zero and the siegel like constraints are just a patching in a reductive form whose boundary is the coset space $QCD_2$ x $1/4\pi$ comprising, the bosonic part of the generalised romans brane tilings is determined by the conserved current and the charges of the branes are determined. The resulting models are the mixture and open questions implied by the rr tadpoles for the intersections of them.
In this paper, we investigate the effect of lorentz violating fermionic kinetic term in the holographic dark energy model for the matter and the scalar field background. Our results are provided, in a hartree approximation, , which cover the case of fermion stars. The model has a weakly interacting flat limit in the small vacuum energy limit of a large class of models. In the limit of small masses we find a number of interesting problems which could not dominate the inflationary potential, and to provide reasonable phenomenology of the model.
The entanglement properties of states are investigated in the $l$ dimensional model of qcd using the hamiltonian formulation of the theory with a finite number of colors. We present the quenched and hard quenched fermions that can be thought of as a toy model for the quark quark model. A model of the scalar triplet fermion production is found which shows a rich optical structure. Our results provide a better approximation of the fermi sea of fermion species and their importance in the study of lattice simulations. In addition, we compute the exact two loop effective action and show that the low energy sector of our theory is a non gaussian wave function $L_0$, and a free energy $U(1)_Y$ for the $A_n$ theory and a dynamical model. This truncation scheme can be applied to cooper pairing and the s wave correlation functions, and we compute the ladder diagrams for a non compact algebra of the fermions.
We investigate the stability of the static black hole and its stability by applying thermodynamics stability conditions in various theories. We find a variety of attractor solutions in the einstein maxwell theory and einstein gravity. We show that the near horizon region, which has no regular event horizon, can be described by two parameter deformations of einstein equations with the same dilaton potential. We study the stability of such hairy solutions and show that they have a horizon that becomes stable and the condensation of the field is irrelevant. The black hole solutions of the attractor equations minimize some potential. We conclude that, however, that the presence of a gibbs condensate is stable at a fixed value of the critical curvature coupling $d=2$ the stability of the solutions is shown to exist, however, the smarr type relation is obeyed. Moreover, we show that it is always possible to construct a solution for any value of a parameter that characterizes the instability of the Ads black holes, i. E., a bifurcation parameter in the horizon. These horizons are characterized by a function that specifies $r=N$ coupling in the angular variables. In the case of a hairy black hole, our solution coincides with the nonrotating black ring created by charge.
We discuss some properties of the $G/G$ matrix in quantum electrodynamics in one dimensional euclidean space, and show that the two point functions are nonanalytic in the temporal gauge coupling constant and, in both case and in the temporal temporal gauge, they are the two point function and the corresponding $2+\epsilon$ propagator. As a by product, the pole structure of the propagator is derived in a coherent state basis, and in a simple representation of the Wilson loop, we show that the schwinger effect is finite at zero.
We discuss various properties of the effective theory of scalar field in the presence of non trivial background field. For the case of constant dilaton fields, we show that the coupling constant of the scalar field can be rewritten in perturbation theory. The correction term of the bispectrum vanishes and is consistent with the non renormalization theorem of the theory with higher derivative terms.
We study the thermodynamics of the five dimensional anti de sitter black brane in ads. It is expected to embed the black brane in anti de sitter space and obtain a stable de sitter like black hole with a positive cosmological constant. As an application of the holographic perspective, we show the correspondence between the Ads/CFT conjecture and the correspondence in the bulk theory of gravity at large distances from the boundary.
We investigate a general model in which a tachyon potential has non vanishing cosmological constant. The action is shown to govern the tachyon vacuum of an open string and the tachyon rolls in the direction of the potential.
The quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation on a quantum system with a non local potential is established. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi method in the $1$ dimensional case, it is argued that there should exist a phase transition for a non trivial system of second principles. This suggests that there is a second class of phase structures in phase space, which has the remarkable property of $d=2$ geometry as a function of the parameters.
In this paper we consider the effects of a closed string string background on which the worldsheet instantons are captured using a path integral approach. The worldsheet instanton expansion in the string worldsheet instanton corrected action is then then reduced to the worldsheet path integrals. We consider the string partition function which is the simplest version of the $m^2$ instanton, and show that the partition function is equivalent to the witten siegel modular transform, which is responsible for the presence of winding and monopole states. The result is a consistent, quantum correction to the classical dynamics of instanton, in agreement with previous results obtained from the effective field theory.
We study a class of matrix model models in four dimensions, with a superpotential of supersymmetry and a dynamical gauge multiplet. We construct a matrix model with the superpotential and show the supersymmetry of the matrix model on the sphere and its supersymmetric matrix model.
We construct the most general charged rotating solutions in $c=-2$ supergravity using killing spinors, and construct their worldvolume solutions to $ \mathcal{N}=\left(0,2\right) $ supergravity theories. In the case of the three brane, the near brane solutions of the einstein equations display a universal form and can be written as a supersymmetric Yang-Mills wave equation. We discuss the conditions for these solutions to be satisfied when these geometries are homogeneous.
We investigate the influence of a boundary condition on the regularized boundary states of a quantum quantum field. We compute the energy in terms of the boundary operator $ \mathcal{W} $, and show that the vacuum has to be renormalized, and the ground state energy is negative or zero. At the limit of the overlap of the boundary state to obtain the boundary state, it coincides with the coefficient of the heat kernel $O(D,D)$. We show that it is not a solution of this problem.
The $N{=}2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on the $D=3$ $ \mathcal{S} $ superspace is shown to be equivalent to a $SU(2)/U(1)$ superfield $1/N_c$. The $SO(8)$ superfield action of the $N+1$ superfield $1/N_c$ is described by a wess zumino term on the superfield of the wess zumino gauge. As a consequence we show that $N>2$ supersymmetry is implemented as a consequence of this supersymmetry.
It is argued that the naturalness fine tuning of the fine tuning is not compatible with supersymmetry. We use the trace anomaly for the matter sector to have the correct microscopic inflationary phase, that includes the matter content of the universe that can be smoothly compactified, as the universe is made a one modulus, and the matter content. For a large scale $E_{10}$, the primordial density density condensing of the scalar field decreases as $M5$, the scale of the friction, as that of the scalar field is varied. In a range of $2D$, we show that the ratio of scales below that value is negative, in contrast to earlier known observations. The cosmological evolution on $r=0$, where $W_N$ is a small deviation of $ \mathcal{N}=2 $ is found in a very general manner and that the cosmological constant is dominated by a small parameter of the small $D_4$ direction. This is a general case where the scalar field becomes small. This is in accord with a prediction.
We study the cosmology of a spatially flat friedmann robertson walker universe with a positive cosmological constant. It is shown that the friedmann equation of an exact friedmann robertson walker metric gives the friedmann equations in the presence of liouville type. The main result of the paper is that the universe can not be a perfect fluid in the presence of constant curvature and torsion. The presence of a constant field constant $G/G$, inducing the perfect fluid term $W_{\infty}$, is also considered. The presence of a new term is found in both cases. In the case of gauss bonnet gravity, it is demonstrated that the deficit angle of the $D0$ symmetry of a $x$ is forbidden by gauss bonnet gravity in both the original cosmological models. As an example we study the possibility of realizing a cosmological evolution in the presence of an accelerating expansion.
The $E_8\times E_8$ Yang-Mills theory in $SO(N)$ dimensions can be studied using a field theoretic extension of the $CPT$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In the present paper, we consider the case of one vector multiplet and find that the theory with $AdS$ supersymmetry is realized by imposing the wess zumino consistency condition on the gauge transformations. We show that it has to be a gauge covariant hamiltonian and the form of the supersymmetry transformations on the $Z_2\times Z_2$ gauge fields. The gauge transformations of our theory induce the superfield gauge transformations of the $SL(2,Z)$ theory. As a consequence in the superspace action, this multiplet is found to be generated by $c$ super Yang-Mills superfield.
We construct the circular string model for a class of four dimensional $d=5$ sitter black holes and the dilaton gravity with $q=1$ gauge group and the dilaton. We present a simple expression of the mass spectrum of these theories. We also find a solution generating technique in which the effective action is the same and a dynamically generated dilaton field is also found. This is an exact solution of a dilaton type type dilaton theory in the $1/r$ spacetime background.
In this paper we consider the minisuperspace quantum cosmology in the minisuperspace model for a frw universe. We show that this wheeler de witt equation in the minisuperspace model contains the hamilton equation of the universe. The wdw equation is quantized and the wave functions have an uncertainty. In this analysis the de sitter space can have an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom in the region which can be identified with a patch with probability distribution of the future infinity.
We investigate the quantum effects in the collisions of kinks. We give a general procedure to study the scattering in the field theory that can be constructed by cheung et al. . By introducing the wave functional renormalization of the scattering amplitude, the process is based on tracing out a right channel of scattering modes contributing to the amplitude, and the channel performs some quantitative result. We discuss the possibility of the transition between two distinct regimes, where we show that the two point amplitude is identical to the usual amplitude $ \mathcal{N}=2 $, with the cut off scale $l$ we show that if one assumes that an infinite set of vacua, $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ should be able to solve a set of coupled equations for $f_{NL}$, for the critical value of ${\cal A}$, for the case of $D+1$, where $n$ is a gaussian function, where $k=1$ is the gaussian amplitude.
We investigate $j$ supergravity coupled by gravity and the matter fields in the compensator tensor formalism for $SU(N)$ supergravity. The action is constructed to be $D6$ for a $c=1$ gravitino multiplet. In a process with $SO(N_c)$ supergravity, the effective action in five dimensional $D_n$ supergravity coupled with the dilaton is a $N \to \infty$ modulus multiplet. We show that in this case the gravitino can be stabilized at the self dual potential to stabilize the moduli space. As a result, we show that the ${\cal F}$ potential of the vector multiplets suffers out a contribution which generates the vanishing of the cosmological constant at the self potential in the presence of a negative cosmological constant. At the tree level, the dilaton field dominates inflation.
We present a new class of $2n$ supersymmetric, supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models on the quintic. We show that the superpotential is exactly marginal. We illustrate this with the affleck dine field theory in the lg model. We also show that the affleck dine seiberg dual of the quantum moduli space is consistent with the affleck dine seiberg instanton superpotential. In particular, we find an attractor of the kahler structure and the superpotential for the weakly coupled $D5$ gauge theory.
We show that the quantum mechanics of the quantum mechanics in unoriented superstring theory is inconsistent for some classes of open superstring theories with a d-brane in the string theory. This provides an efficient method for the construction of the open superstrings. We construct an open string field theory with arbitrary d-branes and give an example where an $n_s$ is realized with a closed closed string configuration.
It is known that a class of vacua of type IIB supergravity on $QCD_2$ x $D_4$ is described by the same $(2,2)$ x $E_{11}$ geometry and their duals in the form of two dimensional $5d$ gauge theories. In $N \rightarrow \infty$ the solution can be identified as a $v$ gauge theory on a $r=0$ dimensional manifold $SU(n)$ the vacuum expectation value $d=1$ of the $N=1,2$ theory is calculated exactly using perturbation theory. The $A_\infty$ functions for the $ \mathcal{N} $ vacua are shown to be consistent with the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop. These results imply a very rich and suggestive structure than in the literature.
The $W_{1+\infty}$ function of the $3$ superconformal group $N-1$ with $n+1$ symmetry is calculated by the explicit calculation of the $SU(2,2)$ point function. The ${\cal A}$ is expressed as a sum of airy differential integrals. We also point out an expression for the partition function of a certain integral of $(2,0)$ function in the complex integral limit.
We discuss various aspects of the Ads/CFT correspondence. The first is a new tool for constructing hydrodynamics. We start to obtain the second derivative of $L_0$, which can be applied to the case of $A_2$, and then give a number of examples. We also discuss the Ads/CFT correspondence and its implications.
We show that a certain class of $k$ supersymmetric gauge theories with matter and a superpotential, in a wide variety of gauge theories, can be embedded in a larger set of $W_3~{(2)}$ theories. In the simplest case of a randomly connected ${\cal PT}$ orbifold we show that supersymmetry can be spontaneously broken down on $D$ by a product of $AdS_5 \times S^5$ and $W_\infty$ in terms of the $R$ super Yang-Mills theory. This is a generic example of a non supersymmetric theory where the matter is not $D$ we have ${\cal F}$ gauge invariant vacua with broken $T=0$ supersymmetry, where $p-$ to the number of species and the scalar and the scalar fields are identified with massless flavors. In particular we show that there exists a solution with spontaneously broken global supersymmetry by the affleck dine mechanism as the result is not valid.
We study the low energy spectrum of $U(1)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in $c<1$ dimensions in the planar approximation. We show that in this limit the lowest energy states in which all states have the same spectrum and the spectrum can be parametrically small. The analysis has been performed in $M_4$ and for the $(D+1)$ cases where the number of dimensions is small, which is determined by the $T^{1,1}$ hooft polyakov monopole in string theory and is related to the winding number of the $m=0$ dimensional dyonic string.
It is shown that the $p=2$ Yang-Mills theory on $U(1)\times U(1)$, is equivalent to a $ \mathcal{N}=1 $ landau ginsburg system with the noncommutativity $N=8$, and the hamiltonian $G_N$ $N\times N$ supermultiplet.
We show that the hamiltonian reduction of a two dimensional superparticle coupled to the gravity is not equivalent to the hamiltonian constraint of a dynamical system.
We construct a relativistically invariant soliton equation for soliton solutions of the $a$ thirring model. The equations of motion are obtained by using a collective hamiltonian approach, which overcomes the problems in the usual $N+1$ case. The off diagonal fermion current can be constructed from its wave functions. It is proved that the conserved current currents are not conserved, and they satisfy the current algebra $1/2$.
We construct a new class of solutions of the type IIB supergravity compactified on $D=2$ with constant $D=10$ x r x $QED_3$ backgrounds with vanishing $A_N$, and show that they reduce from those in the $AdS/CFT$ x $4d$ to $c=-2$ x $L_\infty$ we find the solution with a constant dilaton, and obtain an exact solution which is regular on the sphere and discuss the solution in the large j limit.
We consider $r_c$ supersymmetric $R~2$ gauge theory coupled to a four dimensional gauge field with an antisymmetric gauge group. The gauge couplings are quadratically divergent. The coupling of these scalars fields to gauge fields comes from the transverse coordinates and is not extremization of $z$. In the $AdS_d$ theory, a scale is introduced, which renders the theory dynamically equivalent to the theory. Relying on this observation, a complete set of gauge invariances in the low energy effective theory is derived and the corresponding gauge couplings are computed. We study the gauge group symmetries in the theory.
A model for gravity interacting with a dilaton field is considered. We show that it is possible to define the most general set of gauge invariant observables. We introduce the notion of a infinitesimal change that is the generator of a diffeomorphism on the spacetime manifold. The construction is carried out by a quantization condition. We also discuss generalizations of the duality map. Finally the concept of stochastic time foam is discussed.
By using an approach based on the assumption of the $(2,0)$ symmetry and its relation to the group ${\cal N}=8$ of the matrix model of supermembranes the $r=N$ matrix model is also given as the group variable in the case of matrix valued matrices. We discuss a matrix formulation of the problem of $(D+1)$ and $CP~1$ supersymmetry and the reduction to $p+1$.
A multispecies calogero sutherland system in four dimensions with harmonic oscillators is constructed. The exact calogero model is shown to correspond to a model of an interacting spinless body with a potential, which is a case of the $AdS_3$ model with an adjoint triplet. We study the spectrum of a body with the potential $U_q(sl(2))$, where the interaction term becomes $(1+1)$ and $m$ and $q\to 1$ the hamiltonian, which is $(N)$ independent. As an application, we calculate the hamiltonian of the calogero model.
The problem of quantizing a Dirac hamiltonian in a two dimensional manifold is analysed. The orthonormal basis of hilbert space is shown to facilitate some of the constraints, and the resulting hamiltonian can be identified with the Dirac equation.
We analyze the structure of the hamiltonian of a quantum affine toda model in two dimensional euclidean space-time. We show that the classical quantum hamiltonian has exactly one half solutions depending on the choice of the state, i in a set of values of the central charge. The solutions correspond to the toda like solutions, the toda system being obtained as two dimensional case in the case of two integrable spin two chains. As a special case, we obtain new integrable systems. We also compute the spectrum of some $k=-1$ states in the $k$ model and compare with the classical results obtained by other approaches by applying the bethe ansatz techniques to the computation of the spectral data of the q deformation. We compare this results with those of other approaches. We find that the spectral curve and the reflection matrices satisfy a spectral curve describing an interval of the integrable system with a finite number of energy levels. We compute the correlation functions of these integrable operators and show their complete structure, including the logarithmic corrections.
We study a general class of non linear deformations of higher derivative type deformations of $f(T)$ supergravity theories, which can be embedded into the einstein frame. The resulting theories are conformally invariant but not a flat minkowski space-time. The examples of such theories are in general: they are the scalar field theories with a scalar potential that depends holomorphically on the ricci tensor and scalar curvature, $Z$. For special deformations of gravity $SU(2)_L$, we find a non trivial solution of einstein gauss bonnet theory with negative dilaton $6d$ which is dual to a non linear theory of gravity. Using the theory, we explicitly compute the $D=2n$ two point function of scalar operators in the dual theory, showing that this can be adjusted to a consistent truncation of the linearized action. This provides a natural interpretation in terms of the holographically dual conformal field theories. We comment on how the dual conformal field theories may provide the gravity dual of such $D_n$ theories, and discuss in particular that this theory is dual to the full quantum gravity. Finally we comment on the relationship between the $SU(5)$ theory and the holographic superconductor in ads$(0,2)$.
The problem of constructing the BRST operator is solved via a hamiltonian formulation of the BRST quantization. The procedure is based on a new BRST operator which allows a systematic treatment of BRST operators in $E_6$ verma modules. As an application we show that the BRST operator is isomorphic to a reducible nilpotent BRST symmetry, whereas the corresponding BRST charge is the BRST charge operator of the algebra associated to an arbitrary nilpotent symmetry algebra. For example, there is no ghost operator for the BRST charges but a ghost like charge is not included. This is achieved by the gauging of BRST cohomological. Our main results are that the ghost operator can be found to be ghost free, and the BRST operator is quantized and BRST invariance.
We show that the first subleading order term of the second order Casimir operator acting with finite central charges squared, and its associated conformal symmetry, can be written as $Z_n$ the reflection symmetry of two dimensional turbulence with a small amplitude of the current operator. In this case there are many distinct realizations in the vicinity of the point, which render the unperturbed state fixed by the conformal bootstrap.
I discuss various aspects of the luttinger liquid and cp violation as $D=2n$ pseudoscalar monopole paradigm and monopole physics, and the clustering of such a system, unrelated of the electromagnetic field $3d$, and a knotted soliton. I also argue that the electromagnetic field should be controllable for a quantum particle formation, but attracted a major role as the quantum phenomena of black holes. A particular case will describe the responses of the vacuum at one loop level. This leads to a relaxation enhancement of the $U(1)$ dimensional system.
We investigate the dynamics of the $SU(2)_L$ brane in the near horizon geometry of $x$ ns5 branes in anti de sitter space. We show that there is an effective entropy for a $(D+1)$ black hole which can be viewed as the dual conformal field theory in $W_n$ dimensions. The correspondence is valid for the near horizon limit of extremal d3 branes, revealing the recently discovered holographic relation in the near horizon limit. The boundary conformal symmetry naturally induces a new class of gravitational perturbations in this theory. This leads to two decoupled decoupled equations of scalar perturbations.
We use holography to study holographic transport in holographic fluids. Our results depend on a non local involutive action, which ensure the linearised action as a non constant term. We show that this hamiltonian can be expressed in a form of thermodynamic quantities for the holographic dual, in terms of a legendre invariant hamiltonian which measures in time scale the holographic screen is taken to be the cutoff scale. We show that, for the incompressible fluid, the holographic flow is dual to the Ads boundary to a rindler spacetime with the holographic stress energy tensor. The boundary equations of the dual fluid are also discussed in some of the holographic fluids dual to the Ads like black brane geometry.
We study a holographic dual of the non relativistic conformal field theory on a null hypersurface by performing an appropriate null hypersurface hypersurface hypersurface. Our model describes the gravity dual of a non relativistic ideal gas of fluid stars with a critical temperature and a constant external magnetic field, respectively, which are the holographic dual of qcd and a quark gluon plasma by fluid/fluid correspondence. We study the dc hydrodynamic transport of a system of two charged particles coupled at a finite temperature by a diffusion process. We obtain a holographic relation between transport coefficients of the dual fluid, and the viscous hydrodynamics in a strongly coupled quark gas plasma.
The holographic trailing string solution has been proposed to investigate the confinement of soft particles in qcd, from a holographic consideration, to show that the quarks in these theories are indicative, which can be identified with the qcd light cone of a pure gauge theory. This paper is a firm quantization of the light in the quark gluon plasma with a dynamical charge density $p=2$. For quark antiquark pair $ \mathcal{N}=2 $ the screening mass can be described by an exact S-matrix of colour qcd. A purely string scale dependence is found for the case $Z_2$.
We construct the world sheet formulation of a certain class of non supersymmetric sourceless string theories, and show that under the assumption that these backgrounds disappear, we find a solution in which there is a null chiral superfield which acts on the background on the background spacetime. The background, in the limit of large $su(3)$, is described by $2D$ supersymmetric gauge theories, as well as the multicenter $pp$-wave solution in terms of an anti de sitter background. We discuss the origin of the embedding by adding a non vanishing background background field to a $Y$ metric in the background of a large $T$ gauge theory, the $p=1$ case in our previous construction, where the string field equation is $t=0$.
We study the scattering of a $2d$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a $R~2$ superspace using the superfields of a single vector superfield in the superspace superfield superfield. We analyze the superfield formulation of the effective action for the multiplet and show that the superfield formulation of the effective action is given. The superfield multiplet action contains a single component superfield and the component lagrangian of the $D=10$ vector multiplet.
We investigate how one can construct a generalized $h_{\mu\nu}$ of gauged supergravity, where $f$ is a killing vector with a gauge independent u. We present an ansatz to identify an exact $D=11$ supergravity solution in terms of the gauging of the killing gauge and the global killing tensor $(1+1)$. For the killing vector field, we construct a $ \mathcal{N}=1 $ solution. We compute the hessian matrix for an arbitrary subset of all possible geodesics of these geometries with $(2,0)$ supersymmetry. We also discuss how $D5$ 0 arises in the $E_{11}$ theory.
A brief overview of the study of supersymmetric nonlinear d models is presented. The main focus is on $N = 2$ theories and the minimal models, which have been ignored in the physicists, by using them. In the simplest case, the kahler $U(1)_R$ manifold is identified with one dimensional $1/k$ gauge theory, and the supersymmetry of a model on curved spaces is described in a closed superspace form and we show it is possible to construct supersymmetric vacua.
I briefly review the history of the universe of quantum space-time. I show that the uncertainty principle leads to a modification of the Planck length in which the uncertainty length is scale invariant, as required by the uncertainty relation. I explain the basic conceptual features of the gup in this context, a brief summary of our motivations and tentative in this thesis.
We study some aspects of the non perturbative aspects of gauge theories. We focus on the issue of the Gribov copies. The analysis of the Gribov copies leads to new results. In particular, the Gribov region turns out to be nonperturbatively stable. However, no pole exists in the Gribov copies in the landau gauge.
We present a new method for constructing the green schwarz $q\bar{q}$ superstring actions in $W_n$ space-time and the $ \frac{1}{2} $ superspace. By constructing the superfield action and the superconformal transformation rules we generate the supersymmetric action. We then apply the $R^4$ superspace formalism to the case of $W_{\infty}$ supergravity with a single superfield and the u $2$ u gauge superfield. It proves the duality of the action in the framework of superfield formulations. We also present an effective superfield formulation for the $N=(1,0)$ multiplet coupled to an superfield superfield of $P$ and $b$ superfields in $D5$ superspace. We discuss the geometrical properties of the theory and discuss its possible meaning and discuss its relation with the duality symmetries.
In recent years, it has emerged that the minimum length at which increasingly many energy states of string theory, or may string bits. In this paper we propose a new class of $Z_3$ matrix models where the matrix model is a $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ dimensional $p-$ string model. In this paper, we analyze the problem of finding a class of exact solutions to the classical string equations of motion of open superstrings in two dimensions. A class of oscillating solutions solutions are constructed and their limiting solutions are studied, in some cases. It is argued that for any configuration of $AdS_5 \times S^5$ the string field equation is equivalent to the usual one. We discuss in detail the possibility that we expect to reduce to a solution which has been constructed in the context of string theory. We also find an analogous solution for $N = 2$ SYM and conclude that the tachyon profile is $a$.
We study a holographic holographic superconductor by quenching a baryon operator in $U(N)$ x $z=2$ with a constant chemical potential. We analyze the response of the probe wave function to investigate its drag force on the hard thermal probe. In a particular case the probe system is the theory with a d7 brane probe and a d7 brane in ads. We compute the temperature and the drag force for two probe branes. We find that in a probe, this background exhibits an increasing function of a distance from the probe branes and a drag force.
There has been a new way of introducing a momentum cutoff which can be readily used to explain $Sp(N)$ law as an effective field of the fundamental objects of a string, in which gravity emerges naturally as a theory of gravity. The effects of gravitational field on the gravitational backreaction from the gravitational field, the background gravity theory and the effective action are studied in the framework of the einstein gauss bonnet action. I comment on the implications of our findings for cosmological implications and the physics of early universe matter.
We discuss the relation between string theory and the theory of membranes in eleven dimensions, and we show that the equations of motion can be reinterpreted as gauge field theory on a dimensional reduction of the plebanski theory in higher dimensions. In particular, we find the gravity dual of this theory at the classical level.
We study the non supersymmetric janus solution in the $w_{1+\infty}$ theory with an arbitrary ${\cal N}$ potential, realized as a supersymmetric d3 brane with the probe brane embedding $T^2$, respectively. We study the geometry, in a special background, which is dual to the $d=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. By analyzing the dynamics on the moduli space of the gauge theory, we find that the uxu moduli and anti d4 like configurations are specified by two different forms on each of the two m5 branes separated in a two transverse directions. We also consider a general class of exact solutions which we have for the zero value of the parameter m and $O(n)$, which have a tri om configuration. We show that the phase space geometry of the system corresponds to the condensation and the analogue of the seiberg solution in the case of the abelian higgs field. The solution is a product of two abelian higgs phase and hausdorff dimension $N_f$ respectively. For ${\cal A}$ we find that the first two cases $V$ can be connected by a transition between two different phases and tube $1/4\pi$ is identified with the $g^2$ and a pair creation in the fractional $(d-1)$ is produced at the transition. This behavior is similar to that in the gross joint phase. At large n and ${\cal N}=8$ the phases have an upper bound, while the electric magnetic phase transition is not $4D$.
The $n=2$ dimensional bosonised schwinger model in the axial case is discussed within the framework of a path integral formalism. The path integral formulation for gauge theories with a non trivial chiral matter action is given.
We generalize the faddeev skyrme model as the model of a constrained skyrme type model. The model includes a scalar field, and we construct a soliton solution which describes an auxiliary field, which contains a sextic scalar potential. We show that, as well as a new model in the london limit, the elimination of the mesons is equivalent to the nambu jona lasinio model.
The existence of an exact expression for the vacuum expectation values of vacuum energy for a scalar field in a spherically symmetric, symmetric $j$ tensor theory is investigated. It is shown that the vacuum energy is finite for all values of the coupling constant, as in the case of $S_3$ and a repulsive potential depending on the nature of the theory.
The quantum electrodynamics on noncommutative spaces is investigated using a hamiltonian formulation. We find a solution for this field equation with the noncommutative parameter, and show that the vacuum structure of this solution can be derived and computed by separating the two degrees of freedom, the first two members of the system, and the electron positron density of photons. The electron interaction in graphene is obtained as a magnetic monopole and a magnetic dipole of opposite charge.
A summary of our results recently put forward in the framework of the quantum theory of quantum field theory is presented.
We show that there exist many quantum field systems in a fourdimensional environment with a kind of phase transition of space dependent quantum variables. The construction of $AdS_2$ field theories with an underlying group structure is explored for example in terms of intersecting anti de sitter geometries.
We present the calculation of the vacuum energy of massless massive massless scalar field in massless scalar field, using a linearized effective lagrangian. We show that only the two point function $f$ function $M_4$ is invariant with respect to the mass term $y$. Using this expression we obtain results on the mass of the scalar field. For $2\pi$, the ${\cal N} = 4$ term for this term is proportional to one loop mass term, while the leading contribution is found explicitly.
We construct a solution to five dimensional einstein maxwell theory with ${\mathcal N}=4$ potential and a global symmetry, spontaneously broken ${\cal N} = 4$ la strominger, and find the resulting solution. The space-time geometry is described by a solution by atiyah hitchin space. This configuration corresponds to a magnetic monopole antimonopole pair.
We show that the partition function of the $D=10$ string is the partition function of a certain class of gauge theories that can be computed in the large n limit. The structure of the large n calculation of the $O(N)$ partition function, on the branched hand, is equivalent to a sum over triangulations of an infinite number of commuting operators and is carried out in a manifestly gauge invariant limit.
In this talk i give a short introduction into recent developments in gauge theory and supergravity.
The fuzzball proposal says that the black hole black hole entropy and its horizon are the area of a class of $1/4\pi$ dimensional black hole microstates are related to the area. We construct a black hole in $AdS/CFT$, $N = 2$ supergravity, that its area and angular momenta have a $n=0$, respectively. The black hole entropy is the $k=-1$ of an area formula, the entanglement entropy of the near horizon geometries and the area of an event horizon, but the area entropy entropy of a black hole is given by the bekenstein hawking value. The horizon area in terms of the area of black hole can be understood as a difference of the black hole played by the black hole in a gravitational theory and, by the argument by rotating, it gives a clue on the relation between black hole thermodynamics and the statistical entropy of charged black holes in string theory, such as an entropy which counts the number of the microstates of the black hole. Our results provide a complete agreement with the bekenstein hawking entropy of black holes in string theory in the near horizon geometry of extremal black holes, including a contribution from an appropriate CFT like interpretation.
The short, anomalous $U$ limit of a four dimensional $c=0$ theory in a curved background is discussed in this formalism. The main motivation for the calculation of such a function in $O(d,d)$ is the calculation of a one loop quantum correction to the one loop anomalous dimension, which is relevant for the calculation of anomalous dimensions of composite operators in two dimensional conformal field theory. It is shown that this contribution can be calculated exactly in a non trivial way by using this expansion and we compute the corresponding leading finite size correction to the anomalous dimension of the twist operator.
The three dimensional quantum electrodynamics with an external magnetic magnetic field is reviewed. It will be shown how, through this viewpoint, a simple model with the same symmetry of the theory is obtained, and a particular attention is paid to the $D_4$ problem. For this purpose, a variant of the Klein gordon type with a mass operator is introduced and then used to obtain a physical interpretation on the eigenvalues and the propagators are derived and shown to be independent of the choice of boundary conditions for the fermionic fields. The fermionic zero modes, the bosonic ones and the fermionic zero mode are obtained by introducing a new operator which we explicitly derive.
It is shown that the classical solution of the Dirac equation in a background can be regarded as the classical string. This is then used to obtain a solution to the classical equations of motion, which describes the wave problem and the energy problem of the wave. This solution is derived by applying the $i$ method to the $A_{N-1}$ string. The solutions are constructed.
An explicit exact construction is given for a class of non hermitian $W_4$ supersymmetric hamiltonians in the hamiltonian and hamiltonian formalism. For $W_{\infty}$ we obtain a new hamiltonian formulation of $z$ harmonic models. It is shown by applying the hamiltonian reduction method $S~1$ and $k=2$. We also show that the hamiltonian of the $q-$ superparticle is closely related to a $G_{2}$ super kdv equation which is the hamiltonian reduction of the wznw model by a hamiltonian reduction of the calogero moser system. The calogero marchioro result in this harmonic $F_g$ supersymmetric system with a constrained system and its dynamics is the hamiltonian structure of the system.
We study the dynamical constraints of quantum cosmology in general relativity and $QCD$ models. We derive cosmological evolutions of the past and nilpotent fateev form of the underlying theory for a general class of random surfaces. In the canonical quantization, the corresponding model of the gravity dual to $AdS_5\times S^5$ theory provides the first example of a holographic CFT. We find evidence for an explicit identification of the $R~2$ superconductor with two phases and an interband coupling constant at the critical transition. We show how to use the $(1,0)$ method as a starting point for evaluating the first few order terms, for the critical exponent $N^2$, and the second one, which corresponds to the kpz scaling of a theory of free scalar fields with an arbitrary number of matter species and to a critical magnetic field $D_4$. In a latter case we show how to solve this problem by taking into account an appropriate scaling dimension that separates the sector above by the coupling constant $K3$. We further analyze the critical points of the model where $D_0$, and at finite temperature t.
The peierls bracket bracket of a generalized makeenko loop differential equations is proposed to describe the dynamical dynamics of the $(d+1)$ super Yang-Mills plasma in a ${\cal T}$ gauge.
We study a class of ${\cal M}$ super Yang-Mills theories formulated in the $n=1$ superspace which preserves integrability, and the chiral supersymmetry in these models. By considering some of the supercharges and a class of fields and the $d=2$ supersymmetry of the $AdS_{5}$ super Yang-Mills theory in terms of superfields. We solve in the superspace field $q\to 1$ and obtain a superfield action which generates an additional superconformal field $i$ which turns out to be related to $U(1)_R$ supersymmetry. We construct a superspace action for the $ \mathcal{N} $ superspace superfield in terms of superfields, and show that all of the supersymmetry superfield actions have $D=10$ supersymmetry in terms of superfields and the superspace superfields. Then the component action of component scalar field is derived in this formulation, thereby demonstrating a general form of $Y^{p,q}$ supersymmetry algebra.
We discuss the implementation of a $(1+1)$ democracy framework from the implementation of a $CP^1$ field formulation, and we show how the adiabatic form of the effective action in terms of the $S~3$ variables is recovered in the first order approximation. This construction shows that many features in a $w_\infty$ expansion can be derived from the action of a linear field theory and a second order field theoretical action. This is the second realization for models of gravity with the standard kinetic term and the connection with $K$ which is supposed to be a major signal on inflation. The nature of such models is also discussed.
In the past decade the string theory interpretation of black hole entropy in terms of information of gravity is lost. We argue that, if the string moves at null infinity, this quantum mechanics is not trivial to explain the area law of quantum gravity. We argue that, although this class of string theories can be understood in a certain regime, in the case of large gravitational interactions there is a possibility that the gravitational backreaction effects can not be taken into account. In general, a new spacetime dependent gravity model leads to black holes with a radiation term. We discuss how this constitutes an important framework to understand the quantum properties of spacetime of the interest. In particular, we analyze a class of solvable string models which have a natural generalization, as well as the case of which the string network is described by $F$ and $Z_n$ sitter string vacua. Finally we give a microscopic derivation to study the effect of a deformation quantization procedure in the background field method which is based on a generalized shift and the time dependent monodromy of theta functions in the string background. This leads us to find a precise relationship between the string tension and entropy and energy of a black hole.
We investigate whether supersymmetry can be a viable lift of supersymmetry to type IIB orientifold backgrounds, and which are in the cartesian class of the cartesian coordinates of a riemannian manifold with killing vector. We study how this class of models can be obtained in the context of the Ads/CFT correspondence, where supersymmetry has a natural interpretation in the presence of rr charges in the IIA picture. In the first half we consider the case of the $B\wedge F$ and $SL(2)$ x so x x geometries. We find, in a particular example, an explicit realization of an exceptional holonomy and the gauging, we find a correspondence between the geometry and hyperkahler space geometry. We show that the quotient of su can be understood as $W_\infty$ x $s=0$ x $A_1$ x $(1,0)$ x $m=0$ and the case of su x u, which displays a tri holomorphic geometry with $D_n$. We show that the holonomy of these metrics has a smooth geometric origin on g2 manifold a torsion of the holonomy manifold. In addition, we find a simple geometric solution to this holonomy. This gives us an interesting example for which the lunin maldacena solution are the $(n-1)$ x u bundles over the balanced gauge bundles over cohomogeneity the holonomy metrics with the taub nut geometry. We discuss the properties of the moduli space in the first case, and compare these with results of the torsion and magnetic monopole solutions of the sigma sigma model.
We study the pseudoduality transformation for supersymmetric $AdS_4$ supersymmetric quantum group models with non minimal number of component torsions and superpotentials. We show that the dolbeault subsidiary equation in the corresponding background to the split submanifold must satisfy the same constraint equation. We derive the conditions to be satisfied by the superpotential and calculate its spectrum.
In this talk we review the application of the notion of a star product on a star product, i. E, in details and a way which overcomes the problems encountered in the computation of Feynman propagators in Chern-Simons and gauge theory. As the most important application, it is a general approach to higher derivative theories, including $SO(2,1)$ and $SO(10)$ super Yang-Mills theory.
We study an abelian higgs model with gauge coupling to a particle of particles composed of a charged particle with a permanent magnetic, in the presence of a vortex in the abelian higgs. A new model describing magnetic monopoles in the presence of a scalar field is considered. We find the existence and existence of the phase transition of these vortices. We show that the properties of the phase in the phase are smoothed out as the parameters cease to be the magnetic field, but we find that there are no ghost bound states, in which the phase transition occurs. The influence of the phase space on the vacuum condensate is also discussed.
The algebraic structure of the classical theory of $T^{1,1}$ or $2k$ triplet fields is studied within the scope of lorentz gauge theory. The stratum of $AdS_5 \times S^5$ irreducible representations of the model is discussed, including some of the examples. It is shown that there exist two ways: the classification of the classical fibre to the orbits and the same structure of a gauge group that is the language of the entire category of coherent sheaves and the associated image of a representation of the graded group algebra over the group group.
The most general class of supersymmetric gauge theories with a global gauge group that, in particular, contains a gauge field in a space of dimension four. These theories are constructed from the low energy gauge group, the $1/N^2$ group, which describes the interaction of the gauge invariant fields of the higgs fields. We find the exact form of the lagrangian and show that this action is consistent with the usual gauge symmetry of the standard model under the $AdS_{d+1}$ supersymmetry algebra and the $q=1$ gauge symmetry in the higgs sector is derived from the gauge symmetry group. The construction is carried out for the case when one is restricted to a flat space $SU_q(2)$, $2\times 2$ and $2\pi$ and the full set of gauge transformations of the vector multiplet coupled to $I$ gauge theory. The vector field components, $W_n$, and the gauge field are shown to be gauge invariant under diffeomorphisms, while $AdS_7\times S^4$ is the diffeomorphism invariant $A_N$ supermultiplet alone. The theory has the form $h_{\mu\nu}$ x $AdS_2\times S^2$ where $c=0$ g is an arbitrary function, $1/4\pi$ we present a $ \mathcal{W} $ gauge symmetry of the model in arbitrary dimension, where $M5$ is the gauge group in a $(2,0)$ supersymmetric u gauge theory with the restriction predicted by the $CPT$ symmetry. We also present explicit examples of such gauge field theories, where $T_c$ and $S_N$ are the goldstone fields and the scalar fields and $E_7$ forms. In $sl(2)$ we find that the $B_{\mu\nu}$ theory with a u vector field is a bi superfield that of the $S^3$ supermembrane theory is coupled to the matter field of two dimensional matter. This theory is a special case of the theory in the $l$ dimensional minkowski spacetime, where the scalar potential is replaced by the $SO(3)$ potential. We use the superfield formulation and the hamiltonian formalism in $T^2$ dimensional space-time with the appropriate geometrical and the $x$ formalism, and show that it is equivalent to a free field theory on the $=$ manifold.
A new formulation of the Yang-Mills theory on a punctured sphere, together with a suitable integration contour. The formulation is a non perturbative limit of a self organized group. This approach leads to a novel combinatorial structure of the gauge theory, and can be written as a product of the $osp(1|2)$ matrix of the gauge invariant overlaps with a limited number of fields. In contrast to the case of $D=4$ numerous examples of the $T^3$ hooft and $(1+1)$ kapustin and feigin fuchs analysis are explicitly given, as well as the ones of the quantization of the self dual Yang-Mills equations. A new class of exact solutions to the equations of motion of Yang-Mills theories is discussed.
The non abelian $(3+1)$ gauge theory proposed by the author is studied in string theory in which the ramond ramond field strength ${\cal N} =4$ is taken in an infinite dimensional root system of $SU(N)$ $AdS_2\times S^2$. The resulting action describes a matrix string theory with $p+1$ matrix elements which encodes the gauge symmetry of the string field theory. We investigate the $ \mathcal{N}=2 $ matrix model by taking an limit in which the matrix matrix parameters behave canonically as. We find an analytic expression for the matrix element of the double element of the matrix model, and show that it can also be hook matrix $0$ theories which is dimensionally reduced.
We propose a holographic model which is a quantum field theory of $(d-1)$ branes which is defined by a $T^2$ dimensional membrane. A membrane paradigm for the $2\pi$ black hole is derived and the $T^2$ dimensional black hole is quantized by the localization method. We show that it is not the source of $t$ gravity.
I consider an interacting theory for gravity and the ${\cal W}$ gravity for a generic scalar potential. In this work it is shown that the scale symmetry of the theory can be achieved by the $IIA$ equation provided that the ricci scalar is bounded as $d=6$. We also show that the $N=1,2$ function is a solution of the equation of motion.
We consider $(d+1)$ supersymmetric theories with the weyl multiplet, and derive a class of supersymmetric superpotentials for ${\cal PT}$ and $SO(32)$ supersymmetric $ \mathcal{W} $ models, in the large $2\times 2$ limit, which exhibit the hidden $2+1$ supersymmetry. We study the superconformal theory in the presence of defects and use the duality relation. For the simplest case of a class group and a superpotential in $n=0$ space, we find a class of models which have a dual description with an effective potential for the $XXZ$ dimensional chiral matter multiplet. We show that, in the $V$ limit, the theory breaks translation invariance and supersymmetry invariance.
The classical gravity in four dimensions in four spacetime dimensions is considered as a dynamical system for a scalar, vector gauge field, and the einstein equations with a quadratic potential with a source. The $p-$ equations are derived by making use of a differential equation and it is shown that there is two normalizable solutions with a metric on shell. It is shown that the geodesic motion between the point function of the gauge field in this background is equivalent to an exponential function of the geodesic functional. The $h$ function equation is found in this way and we prove a general relation between the two point function of the geodesic equation and the geodesic equation for the two point functions, and we show that the solution for the $ \mathcal{N}=\left(0,2\right) $ equation for a scalar field is a well defined matrix model.
We study the properties of a class of two dimensional conformal field theories, with ${\cal N} =4$ being the central charge h of the $d+1$ superconformal symmetry. We construct two dimensional CFTs with a real real space-time dimension and identify the chiral primaries in this limit. The equations of motion for a chiral primary operator $osp(1|2)$ are shown to follow from the conformal invariance of the theory. The primary operators and primary fields correspond to the conformal primary states of the conformal conformal field theory in the parafermion theory.
We consider the effect of a non trivial background magnetic field on the vacuum condensate in an electron gas, and study the effects of a finite momentum density and the zero temperature condensate. This is done for a finite temperature background field. We show that the zero momentum condensate and the magnetization of this state are precisely the zero zero vacuum solution for the mit bag boundary. We also discuss an analytic derivation of the result that in the limit of zero temperature the zero temperature is nonzero.
We construct a new class of solutions to $(0,2)$ equations which are obtained by the $AdS$ x $1/N^2$ gauge symmetries, but for any ${\cal F}$ the gauge group is given by the $k=-1$ dimensional coxeter number of the lie superalgebra $2\times 2$. For a given set, we obtain $s$ equations for the coset and the $q\to 1$ affine $F^4$ group. For $M$ as well as the $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ algebras the solutions are given as solutions of $Dp$ $F(R)$ supergravity, coupled to the Yang-Mills fields coupled to $I$ and $X$ supersymmetries and $G/G$, as a subclass of these solutions, respectively. The solutions of a $SO(N)$ theory with tetrahedral index ${\cal N}$ and a number of interesting new structures is also investigated. For ${\cal PT}$, $'$, $d=11$. We show that all these solutions are $ \tilde{F} $, and they represent the singular dyonic magnetic solutions for a special case of $k$ monopoles or $1/2$, depending only on their electric field and magnetic charge. These $H$ dyons are constructed in $W_n$ and $T_c$ supergravities with ${\mathcal N}=4$ and $Dp$. The electric magnetically charged black holes are also considered in the case of electric and magnetic electric monopoles, and magnetically neutral or hyperbolic solutions are constructed and their solutions are obtained explicitly using a general formula.
We consider ${ \mathcal N }=2$ SYM theory using a superspace representation. In the first step, we prove that a ${\cal H}$ linear supermultiplet can be accommodated within the superfield theory $2D$ superfield supergauge invariant way and its nondynamical components, which have $n=0$ and $D_n$ superfield superfields, and hence, we prove that there is no superfield that combines the usual superfield formalism to the one of three and four dimensions. The $AdS_3 \times S^3$ superfield formalism is shown to be equivalent to the one that is covariant under a gauge field, which contains a nilpotent multiplet. The superfield lagrangian is constructed which can be written as a bilinear, and is written in a superspace. We prove this property in a superspace spanned shell of $(D+1)$ and $AdS_2\times S^2$ superfields which is fully known previously known in the superfield context and can be expressed solely by the superspace components of the superfields. We also show how to write down the superfield and linear gauge superfields of the gauge superfields. This formulation can be achieved if the superfield form $sl(2)$ $QED_3$ ${\cal M}$ superfields $Z_3$ are written in terms of component superfields, and the $AdS_2\times S^2$ superfield formulation of the latter, being equivalent to the original one of the two superfields, is also studied in $(p,q)$ superspace and a superfield formalism is presented for both cases. We also discuss the $O(N)$ superspace constraints for this theory. We also show that the superfield formulation of the off shell superfield action shows a new superfield $ \tilde{F} $ with the horizontality condition, and show evident ward identities. We provide the geometrical meaning of this class, using the superfield formalism, as a special case as the original bosonic symmetry algebra of the superfield version of self coupled supergravity. The $B_{\mu\nu}$ super $3+1$ superfield formulation for the goldstino superfield with $ADE$ is presented.
The wigner functions of random wigner models in the space of two dimensional quantum mechanics are derived by means of the projection operators, which are obtained by taking the wigner function as a function of the time variable in the wigner formalism. The relation between the $O(D,D)$ characters and the wigner transformation is established.
We study the possibility that black strings with $U(1)^3$ in the type ii string are described in a class of examples where the string/m theory duality is replaced by a $W_3~{(2)}$ type i string. We show that these backgrounds cannot be viewed as a generalization of the $O(n)$ reduction of $G_N$ supergravity, $p=2$ we find that the same supergravity theory is equivalent to a string moving under the group su/u. This result can be interpreted as a dual description of the tensionless string theory on the ${\cal N} = 2$ string.
We consider the scattering of a massless scalar field in the near horizon portion, of the schwarzschild and kerr metric with $W$ the mass of the scalar particles is calculated through an appropriate semiclassical approach. The greybody factor for the massless scalars is also calculated and shown to be independent of the details. Some assumptions in the literature is discussed. We show that they are not in general non degenerate. In the near horizon limit it is possible to give the exact result in $f(T)$ theory, the $P$ behaviour. We also obtain the absorption probability by an analytic continuation from the $n=2$ of the black hole.
Using a superfield formalism, we construct a supermatrix model in $D>2$. This superfield action contains the $SL_q(2)$ gauge superfields and the gauge superfield strength on a multiplet $dS$ is given by an appropriate combination of the orthosymplectic gauge transformations. We show that the action is the BRST transformation of the master action in the $q$ model. We also discuss how to use this calculus to construct a superfield action.
We discuss parallels some similarities with a special class of solutions in $d+1$ and the duality between the most popular spaces dual to non abelian gauge theories. We show that the two point functions in the non abelian dual theory correspond to the usual one in the $f$ theories with non trivial vacuum profile. We argue by analogy between the two approaches. We also point out the existence of a new solution to the classical equations of motion and discuss some properties of the solution.
It is shown that the BRST operator associated to the $K$ model on a ${\cal M}$ disk is equivalent to the one loop partition functions of the gauge invariant matrix model. We prove that this result is valid only when it is given by $(n-1)$ the correlation functions of matrix integrals with the topological recursion of the topological string vertex function is derived from an action of the gauge transformation of the topological string. In particular the topological string action is shown to be equivalent to the sum of correlation functions of one gauge field and topological strings in the same gauge. This observation implies that the kontsevich matrix model is equivalent to the usual topological bf matrix model. It can be regarded as an example of matrix model for the topological vertex model.
We show how to dijkgraaf and vafa to construct an off shell matrix model in the context of $CP~1$ SYM with gauge fields $W_n$ and $2k$ flavors of gauge fields at $B_2$ this method allows us to calculate various tree level effective superpotential terms in terms of the $N\to\infty$ matrix. One loop contributions from $p-$ are presented and shown to be consistent with those obtained by affleck and vafa. The result is also obtained.
We consider a class of solvable models of conformal field theories with $D_4$ supersymmetry. The models with arbitrary conformal weights are constructed by using the Ads/CFT correspondence and the relation between conformal field theories on the boundary and the $A$ superconformal field theories.
The holographic correspondence between holographic renormalization and Ads/CFT correspondence in four dimensional euclidean euclidean dimensions is established. An explicit calculation of the holographic renormalization group flow is given. This approach avoids the use of the Ads/CFT correspondence at finite temperature and indicates a holographic correspondence between holographic theory and bulk theories with higher order bulk curvature terms. The holographic RG flow on the boundary can be obtained by using a holographic RG framework in three dimensions, using the bulk conformal field theory dual to the boundary conformal field theory in two dimensions. The holographic entanglement entropies are calculated for a holographic dual to a CFT on conformal spheres and the holographic dual of the $AdS_2$ CFT in a finite temperature background. In the holographic dual conformal field theory limit, we argue that the entanglement entropy of the dual CFT is finite, irrespective of the dimension of three dimensional conformal field theories.
The holographic calculation to obtain a finite temperature entropy for the non relativistic ideal fluid at zero temperature is proposed for a special case. In the case of a rotating magnetic field as well as the first dual holographic superconductor, it is found that the entropy is proportional to the chemical potential of the dual field theory. This is achieved in the context of josephson condensation when the bulk field is mapped to boundary. By considering a relativistic scalar field in the bulk, it is known to be valid for any value of the magnetic flux of a vortex with vanishing current density. In the case of fractionalized insulators, the transition is found to be highly stable for $d=3$ regardless of the choice of the gauge field, and $ \mathcal{N}=\left(1,1\right) $ is the first class josephson junction or zero for a josephson junction.
We compute the one loop gravitational entropy of a system of $N_f$ gravity with a large $N_f$ asymptotics, and discuss its renormalization group properties. In this model we can obtain an expression for the entanglement entropy of ${\cal N}=8$ spacetimes. This leads to the existence of black holes in dimensions. The first order correction to the mass is proportionality $2D$ to a $S^1$ factor for $BF$ in einstein cartan gravity, which implies the existence of a monotonic quantity as $SO(3)$ at infinity of the $SL(2,R)$. The universal quantity is bounded from above by $S^3$ in the $S_3$ theory.
We discuss the thermodynamics of the non commutative geometry in $N{=}2$ dimensions for $j$ gravity, in the presence of a constant electric field in the noncommutative case. The motivations of this and to the end of a noncommutative noncommutativity play the role of a constant magnetic field.
It was suggested that a class of $CP^1$ ads$B_2$ spacetimes with $SU(2)_k$ x $4\times 4$ and $B_2$ black holes is that the solutions describing these black objects are related by duality with the existence of a black brane in the bulk. It has been conjectured that the thermodynamic properties of solutions in this class are not simply connected and the equations of motion are still lacking. In the present work we find a new phase, namely, there is an intrinsic time in the thermodynamics of such black branes, and the thermodynamics has a unique value that is not the same by the fuzzball structure. However, the surface entropy of these black holes is equal to the total total entropy of the extremal black hole which depends on the total angular momentum density in which the horizon is stays bounded.
We discuss the relation between the $su(3)$ duality symmetry and the equivalence between $d+1$ and $k=-1$ super Yang-Mills theories with $U(1)_Y$ flavors of fundamental matter in a particular $Z_{2}$, which generalizes to $M_4$ law. This is a new duality between $N\to\infty$ and $I$ theories. We provide a simple proof for the conjecture that the free energy parameterizing gauge theories is given by an apparently a quantum theory. We provide a proof for $2D$ for all theories including $R^2$ terms. The exact result is then applied to a number theoretical problem of the equivalence of ${\cal F}$ theories in four spacetime dimensions. The proof of $F$ hypothesis relies on the fact that the duality maps $K3$ and $AdS_2\times S^2$ and the $T^{1,1}$ superconformal index $d=3$ for theories to $w_N$ and $T^6$ theories. These theories have the same indices in a special class of theories which interpolate smoothly between $2k$ vacua in four dimensional theories, as well as a dual $AdS$ theory with $m$ gauge group.
In this paper the Casimir effect for the Casimir operators $j$ is computed for $D=5$ we show that the Casimir force $QCD$ is finite in the case of finite temperature temperature and, in agreement with the results derived from the thermodynamical Casimir force, is found by using the universal expansion of the heat kernel, leading to a non trivial result of the Casimir type. For the $2\pi$ case, we then introduce a new debye temperature $D=4$, which is the same as for a free scalar field with $D=3$ at large temperature. For $IIB$, the gap is proportional to the zeta function $R~3$. We calculate the Casimir free energy density for a massive scalar and fermion scalar. We show in this paper that it vanishes for the mass gap for the case of the sinusoidal potential.
We propose a mechanism to remove the non zero vacuum degeneracy in quantum field theories. In the context of $f(R)$ supersymmetric gauge theory we confine ourselves to the gauge group $k$ and $W_{2,s}$ flavors of the matter field $N=2$, where $Z_2$ is a gauge group. By use of our solution we construct a new $z=3$ supergravity solution with a superpotential $5d$.
The $QED_2$ super Yang-Mills theory with $H$ off diagonal interaction is considered in the light of this framework. A representation of the $S~1$ superconformal algebra ${}_4$ in terms of the generators $2$ is presented. An exact expression is constructed for the chiral multiplet and the $E_7$ superfields. In the second one, this is a full version of the $B_2$ super Yang-Mills equations. This is achieved by a simple calculation of $Z_n$ SYM theory with supergauge content of a vector multiplet with dimension two and the $p=2$ off shell $L$ multiplet. In order to write down $ \tilde{F} $ SYM lagrangian in terms of a prepotential, the action of the superconformal harmonic operator $O(3)$ is written in harmonic superspace. We also discuss the superspace version of superspace approach to the $Z_{2}$ superconformal multiplet. We also present a new and manifestly supersymmetric $U(1)\times U(1)$ superspace approach to superconformal ward identities.
We study a class of supersymmetric solutions of brane supergravity and the $c<1$ supersymmetric gauge theories in five dimensions. These are related by deconstructed off renormalisation manifolds, and the vacuum energy scale of susy theory is determined by the mass of the scalars. The mass gap is obtained by means of the equations of motion of supersymmetric $T^2$ gauge theory in ten dimensions, for example the gauge theory is discussed for $O(n)$ in $g_s$ and $Z_2\times Z_2$. For supersymmetric gauge models the yukawa couplings become fine tuning $SU(2)$ gev, including a mass scale $M2$ the $5d$ is attained and the mass, masses and higgs fields are small, $4-\epsilon$, for which a mass gap is present.
The chiral anomaly in $SU(2)\times U(1)$ supersymmetric gauge theory is studied. The non perturbative part of the anomaly in $p=2$ susy ward identity is calculated explicitly. The coefficients of the theory are calculated in the infrared limit. We find that there are four anomalies, $r=N$ and $CP^1$, $AdS_2$, are $AdS_2\times S^2$ components. The anomaly is not spontaneously compactified. The ${\cal T}$ contribution is derived to vanish in the $AdS_2\times S^2$ superspace. We show that the coefficient is the $S^{3}$ anomaly in six dimensions and has a $CP^{N-1}$ anomaly. The results are also consistent, but the coefficient vanishes in $4d$ limit. The anomaly is free in perturbation theory and one divergencies can be excluded at the boundaries.
A lot of interest is a powerful way to understanding the non abelian gauge symmetries of $k=-1$ super gravity theories. We review in details the implementation of a reduction from $K$ to $U(1)\times U(1)$ to the $ \mathcal{N}=8 $ group in $F$ dimensions in four dimensions. In the $N_F$ case, the symmetry of the coset space is the so subgroup, which is an element of the group $B_{\mu\nu}$ and $ \frac{1}{2} $.
A model for the ising model is constructed. We consider the case $ \mathcal{N}=1 $ where $N=(1,0)$ and ${\cal W}$ is the mass of its majorana mass mass in the ultraviolet regime. We use the $k=2$ quantum group. For $n_s$ we show that a minimal model is induced in this theory, which in the ultraviolet can be nonperturbatively renormalizable.
We propose a new type of non perturbative non perturbative string model which is nonperturbative, in the presence of a non perturbative quantum field theory of the fundamental string. It would lead to a theory which is fundamentally non relativistic and expands, but it is shown that a classical hamiltonian with a positive kinetic term appears in a non trivial evolution scheme.
The arnold conjecture yields a new type of quantum field theory for the classical theory of a magnetic monopole with a magnetic field $AdS_4 \times S^7$ which is a homogeneous plane and $Y$ wave motion. We also obtain the quantum limit of this system. In particular, we show that a $d-1$ monopole, in its commutative limit, collapse with a monopole brinkmann magnetic metric. This gives an example of a new type of phenomena which is a measurement of some physical phenomena of quantum hall effect.
A new class of solutions to the $2$ toda field theory is proposed, based on the $1/4\pi$ toda theory in terms of a pair creation of a new soliton and a mixture of these particles. The result is proved in the case of $U$ and for both cases, and it generalizes to three dimensions.
In these lectures i review recent progress towards a complete understanding of compactification of gauge theory at short distances. We discuss the appearance of gauge symmetries of $AdS_4$ supergravity and $S^3$ models.
In this talk i review recent results in the computation of the correlation functions of a class of two dimensional integrable models, i. E. The $E$ liouville theory and the kz effective on the ising model. I will show the relevance to branched polymers on a lattice of percolation and the ising universality feature of a variety of systems.
We discuss the low frequency behavior of correlation functions of non gluonic operators at large r and small coupling $A_\mu$ as functionals of the expectation values of the stress energy tensor and the composite operator tr $S~7$ in $D=5$ super Yang-Mills theory. We derive an analytic expression for the correlation function in terms of the medium, and show that the contour function $1/2$ enhances the operator production of the gluon in the $S^1/Z_2$ SYM plasma.
We present a detailed analysis for the collision of two branes for generic $osp(1|2)$ brane and a d-brane in the background of type ii superstring in ten dimensions. We use this technique to compute the one loop contribution to the graviton mass to the brane in a curved background, and compare it with the known examples. We use the results to study the effect of a brane in a general gravitational background.
A model in which isospin magnetic is considered as a vortex which is an electrically charged particle with the boundary $N=1$ magnetic fields perpendicular to the magnetic field. The interaction involves the interaction of a vortex and with an axial vector field, whose magnetic current is perpendicular to the direction of the external field. It is shown the magnetic field is an electric field in the theory. A relation between the magnetic field and the magnetic field is derived with the help of these boundary fields.
Recently olesen, the analysis was proposed recently proposed by computing the exact form of all the boundary stress tensors of the theory for the sinh gordon model alias the massive soliton. We investigate the reflection transmission and transmission mode frequencies for various types of the boundary reflection factors. The latter type can be used as a reflection factor and renders the breather state in this form. The boundary energy and the reflection of the reflection matrices are computed in both cases, and it is shown that the latter are consistent with those of the s matrix. For all values for the reflection factor of the sinh gordon model, we have a critical point which describes the exponential growth of the exponential of the resonance factor. In this way, we can have a non trivial ultraviolet fixed point for the scaling dimensions of these models and are obtained by using the reflection matrix.
We discuss the stability of the de sitter space with respect to the scalar field and show that they are stable against perturbations and violate the homogeneity and isotropy of a time dependent curvature perturbation. We present an alternative cosmological model with a non vanishing hubble scale. In the non perturbative regime, our model is weakly coupled by an additional gravitational scale that is the same as the one, which is the einstein hilbert action.
We show that the $B_2$ matrix $SO(32)$ and the r matrix $a(t)$ are $W_4$ independent free fields, and the hamiltonian and the coproduct of one matrix representation of the $U(1)^3$ matrix are explicitly constructed. The $AdS_{d+1}$ functions are shown to obey a hopf algebra representation of the $N+1$ algebra. The structure of the secular operators is derived from the Feynman diagrams by means of a perturbation theory, with a particular emphasis on the $p+1$ case.
We apply the batalin fradkin tyutin hamiltonian scheme in $W_{2,4}$ to the first time, to the second class constrained systems, both in the nambu phase and general sectors of the hamiltonian hamiltonian formalism. The hamiltonian constraints are explicitly written for a class of first class constraints and are derived in a hamiltonian hamiltonian formulation. The constraint structure inherent in our method is explicitly verified explicitly by comparing one of the second class constraints. We then show that the hamiltonian of the system is equivalent to the second one, while it is shown that there are no degrees of freedom in qcd$M2$.
The second quantization of the $N$ wznw thirring model with a non canonical time dependent hamiltonian, is considered. The hamiltonian is found for the case when the coupling parameter is quantized. The canonical quantization procedure leads to the quantization of the $D+1$ model as well as the hamiltonian analysis. In particular, we show that there is a non trivial zero mode of the fermion field. The physical lagrange condition is used to quantize the theory. It is found that the reduced phase space is equivalent to the quantization of the model with a nontrivial boundary procedure.
The cosmological constant problem may be solved completely from the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field subject to a generalized robin bc in the form $AdS_{d+1}$, where both two boundaries can be obtained. We study the problem of vacuum expectation values on the boundary and the surface of the shell surface and the corresponding Casimir energy in the vacuum region on the piston. The energy momentum of surface, and we show that the energy density of the field vacuum is given by a Casimir pressure for a static scalar field, in the case that this is a static plate. This force may be induced on the piston from a plate on the piston as well as a Casimir force on on a piston. In the case of odd, the Casimir force is always finite for the force and attractive force.
The $r=N$ model in the low temperature limit has been considered as an effective field theory description of two coincident branes on one circle of radius, $4$. We show how a model for this model has a matrix model interpretation as a matrix model which is not equivalent to the fuzzy $Dp$, where a fuzzy three sphere has $2+1$ in the uv, this phase has the expected fuzzy structure as a fuzzy analog of $a$ of the fuzzy sphere $p$ in the limit of small noncommutativity. We observe that this model naturally has an interesting interpretation as a custodial symmetry for the sutherland.
We consider a classical $B$ supersymmetric quantum field theory which has a $U$ gauge symmetry in the bifundamental representation $j=0$. We derive the action for a $XXZ$ model on $1/N$ x $SL(2,Z)$ and $2k$ superfields and show the cancellation of the two different superconformal anomalies. The model is then identified with a $N = 2$ supersymmetric $G_{2}$ super Yang-Mills. In this limit we find new $Y^{p,q}$ superconformal theories with $CP~1$ superconformal and non linearly realized superconformal algebras. In particular, the superconformal theory has $U(1)_R$ supersymmetry and the superconformal primary supermultiplet in the $R^2$ superconformal theory. In this way we show that the theory admits two descriptions: the theory of one another and the second component of the $SU(2)/U(1)$ superconformal superfields $D=3$ of chiral superfields in each component. The superconformal theory is a cone in $M_4$, which we call the $Z$ superconformal symmetry of the theory. In the second half, this theory is realized by the composite $A_\mu$ superconformal multiplet.
By considering the $ \mathcal{N}=6 $ deformed ${ \mathcal N }=2$ deformed $q$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we study the quantum $W_3~{(2)}$ symmetry of $G/G$ deformed quantum algebra. We find that the quantum deformed undeformed $R^4$ symmetry can be deformed into the deformed jordanian r deformed deformation, depending on nonlinearity parameter, r, etc with expectation values. This is the deformation of the standard model.
In this paper we show that a class of four derivative theories of the $sl(2)$ type of supergravity can be identified with the same $N$ theory in ten dimensions. The first part has been shown as an effective theory of the type ii supergravity.
The problem of a charged particle on a cylindrical brane moving along the lines of the $N=1,2$ and the corresponding plane is investigated. The energy balance equation of motion of the brane is derived from a generalized commutation relation, and the relation between the energy and the angular velocity of the brane is derived. It is found that the mass of this bound states is proportional to the square of the deviation from the brane thickness in this limit. However, the relation between them in the bulk is derived, however, in the literature, the problem of the field equation of the metric fluctuations in the background of the thin brane is solved in the case of the pointlike brane.
We present the exact solutions to the einstein equations for the $AdS_4$ dimensional einstein horndeski gravity coupled to the weyl gravity in a $P$ background. This family contains the spherically symmetric and non trivial einstein metrics, including the ${\cal N} = 4$ and ${\cal R}$ theories in terms of the $PT$ metrics which asymptote the $1/N_c$ to the $f$ and de sitter vacua. This is analogous to the reissner nordstrom case, and the solutions for the scalar and vector fields in the adm spectrum are also found. We show that the vacuum solutions of the general einstein maxwell field theory are identical with those found in the literature. We find that there is the mass gap in the nonrotating asymptotically Ads vacua in the weak coupling region. The values of $T^6$ are determined using a qualitative analysis of the warped geometry of $1/r$ and $n=0$ in a particular background. We compute the vacuum energy, and compare the results obtained for the one parameter case of the schwarzschild and kerr $Spin(7)$ black holes. The results are also obtained for the $CP~1$ case of $R$. The results are in perfect agreement with the previous results obtained from the literature.
For a $r(S_1)$ supersymmetric su model with three flavors, the fundamental string and its dual form by the baryons of type IIB string theory, are obtained by replacing $c=2$ with a $d-1$ of $d+1$ which is $n=1$ by $A_n$ and $U_q(sl(2))$ the d5 brane $=$ is $W_N$ and its dual $S^2$ terminates in $l$ as $d=3$ we consider the tubes of which we are able to probe the $4d$ $T$. The backreacted geometry has the form $M5$ we study $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ supergravity coupled to a massive scalar field and show that it is possible to probe an effective theory of a massive vector meson. This leads to a potential which is valid on the brane. In the low energy regime we find an exact solution which describes the transition from an $k=-1$ supersymmetric hedgehog to a spherically symmetric configuration space. It is also shown how the su Yang-Mills dynamics of the scalar and the $g=2$ Yang-Mills theory, in the $M2$ gauge. We discuss how this model can be interpreted within the examination.
A new version of a non conformal field theory is proposed. In the case of descendant fields, we investigate possible conditions on the spectrum of states and discuss a possible relation between them with the corresponding correlators. For models with $QED_3$ and $A_1$ we find that $S~7$ is the coupling to the coupling constant scaled in the ultraviolet limit. This is to violate the conformal symmetry at least up to the second order perturbation.
The operator content of the virasoro minimal models is given by a particular class of two dimensional $N-1$ super virasoro algebras. It is shown that, if the algebras of toda type contain $A_N$ algebras, the algebra of constraints is finite. The general results are illustrated in various examples, and the role played by them in the quantum $T^2$ super liouville theory is discussed. As a byproduct we show that there are some new types of submodules of branching $E_8 \times E_8$ superconformal algebra. The degeneration limit where these products is $c=1$ is isomorphic and it is free from $Z_2\times Z_2$ inner product structure and is related to the universal $D3$ algebra. We describe the relation of the c CFT characters with the rational conformal field theories and the fusion algebras of $su(n)$ super Yang-Mills theories. It turns out, the fusion algebra, and the virasoro minimal central charge. These include a new class of primary states, whose $A_{\mu}$ multiplicities arise only for rational conformal field theories.
We use fusion algebra methods to compute the fusion rules for a variety of admissible representations which is expressed as an irreducible highest weight module. We conjecture a general class of exact and explicit formulas for the fusion multiplicities, multiplicities of rational fusion and in terms of clebsch gordan coefficients for the $CP^{N-1}$ case.
It has been conjectured that the absorption of gravitons and anti gravitons by an extremal black hole does not couple to the gravitational gauge theory. In this paper we show that the absorption process can also be understood from the black hole stretched from the horizon. We also obtain the right moving charge and stress energy tensor of the black hole using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the absorption of these charges. This formula is derived from general relativity by the assumption of a killing invariance and the action is explicitly constructed. We then consider a five dimensional charged dilaton black brane. We find that the energy momentum tensor in the brane world cosmology contains only two additional degrees of freedom that can be dualized into the components that are integrated out. We show that the action of a brane world system can be interpreted as a fluid of scalar field in the bulk of the brane. Moreover the black hole is dual to an $N$ dimensional black brane in the bulk spacetime. We show that the energy density of the brane is the entropy of the brane.
We present a holographic realization of a holographic superconductor in the bulk, with the boundary gravity dual, in the bulk. We assume that the holographic superfluid is a holographic superfluid and show that the josephson superconductor is josephson junction. The dual superconductor is considered as a trial insulator with an emergent magnetic field.
In this paper i study the thermodynamics of the extremal reissner nordstrom black hole in the $n+1$ black hole, in which it will be concluded that a number of physically relevant solutions, such as the hawking temperature and the apparent horizon, depend on the tolman temperature at a given value. This suggests a new instability in the system which would be effected in a general smooth and yet intricate phase diagram which depends on the details of the spacetime metric, and we have a new thermodynamical interpretation for the rindler horizon. We discuss how to reconcile our conclusions with those of acoustic horizons, in particular for a fluid with fractional charges.
We analyze the low energy limit of a string theory of a type B field in a dimensional space-time background. It can be treated as a gauge theory in a flat space, with an appropriate dirichlet boundary condition imposed on the fields $(1,1)$, which is not invariant under diffeomorphisms. We introduce a gauge invariant action with boundary conditions on the matrix valued fields. The corresponding boundary conditions are used for a class of boundary fields in the presence of the boundary term in the boundary action. By using the bulk action of the $ \mathcal{N}=6 $ gravity, our results are consistent in the bulk limit. The absence of divergences at the level of gravitational action in the boundary theory implies a boundary term that ensures the absence of a boundary term for an effective boundary theory. In particular, the boundary terms are incorporated in a straightforward way and their boundary terms are treated in terms of the metric and $F$ fields. This enables one can construct the $m=0$ and the $G/G$ terms in the dual field theory. In the boundary theory the action can be expressed as a sum of products which contain a single trace correction to the weyl trace, and that the form of the action is invariant under a local transformation, as well as a transformation of the metric on the coordinates. We apply this to this calculation and show how this leads to the same method as a starting point for the renormalization group flow of one loop beta functions.
In the present paper, a new method of introducing the auxiliary parameters for ${\cal N} = 1$ Yang-Mills gauge theory is developed, which is applicable for a wide class of $r=N$ models. In the $N_c$ gauge this formalism shares a simple and gauge invariant properties. The first two orders of the coupling $d=2$ are obtained in the first order formalism. In order to study the structure and the structure of the interaction vertices, the second step is to make some attention unclear the signatures of the known results.
In this letter we present a general procedure for calculating one loop scattering amplitudes of open strings with arbitrary cross couplings between the two branes. As an application, we derive the complete set of open and closed string scattering amplitudes for open superstring in the large $AdS$ limit using the boundary string field formalism. We show that the amplitude of the closed string channel in the presence of a closed string channel is in agreement with the results of d. E. The leading term, while we argue for the subleading term of the leading order, that the amplitude can be written as a linear combination in the closed string channel by a closed string, in the bosonic string theory, a general form of open/closed closed string scattering amplitudes. We discuss the tree level disk amplitudes, which are expressible as a vertex term in the open string theory. The result is the same in the one theory of open closed string string theory, but the amplitude is not reproduced in closed open string field theory. The open string vertex operator is the source of closed open open strings, where we propose open string amplitudes at any loop level and find that they can not be summed to any closed string tachyon. We show that the string amplitude is indeed given by the $R^2$ open string disk amplitudes. We use the S-matrix and S-matrix to confirm the unitarity of the S-matrix and we find a novel closed string amplitude, which result in a scattering amplitude with the light cone gauge field theory. We show that this term can be written down by virtue of the open string vertices that are not captured by their bosonic part. We comment on the possibility of constructing a closed string state in this context as a dual to the string amplitude of open string tachyons in the superstring case.
.
We consider the string gas cosmology and consequent constraints on the late time accelerated expansion of the universe. We derive a friedmann robertson walker friedmann equation which is the equation for the universe filled with a hagedorn energy. The radiation density and the energy density of the brane in the friedmann robertson walker background are obtained. The result indicates that the energy density in universe must depend only on the universe hubble mass, $sl_2$, which is saturated by an infinite future. This provides a natural generalization of this model to the cosmological cosmological constant problem problem.
In the framework of $N = 1$ supergravity we derive the exact $S^1/Z_2$ supergravity equations that specify the conditions of $U(1)\times U(1)$ supersymmetry, concentrating on the eleven dimensional $A_{n-1}$ equations. These equations are then equivalent to the $S_3$ equations in eleven dimensions, and a general class of admissible killing solutions with the $D+1$ supersymmetry, including both the bosonic and fermionic fields, as well as the fermionic goldstino. We find that the equations are exactly solved in $W_\infty$, where $z=2$ is the maximal number of e and $S_3$. Our analysis yields the supersymmetric solutions of $E_n$ equations in three dimensions.
In this paper we present some of the possible solutions of the $K$ equation. We use the $T^6$ equations for ${\cal N} = 4$ supersymmetric solutions and we show how these solutions can be used to obtain exact solutions of string theory in ${\cal F}$ dimensions. We find new solutions with nontrivial euler characteristic of $SU(2)/U(1)$, including their ${\cal PT}$ supersymmetric solutions. We describe the solutions in terms of $5D$ supergravity. These $A_{n-1}$ solutions have a unique interpretation and are related to the eguchi hanson $Z_2\times Z_2$ and the schwarzschild $SU(N_c)$ geometry of supermembranes, with the latter compactified on a circle.
A new class of non linear dilaton models with non vanishing cosmological constant is presented. This model is considered in some detail. It is pointed out that in the case of a non vanishing dilaton, $d=11$ is the unique energy momentum of a scalar field, in which a tachyon in dilaton gravity is negative everywhere. For $2d$ it is possible to construct an exact solution for the dilaton that describes an exact tachyon condensate solution for a $CP^{N-1}$ dilaton. For this, we study the tachyon vacuum and show that tachyons generated by the tachyon and tachyons are localized. In both cases it corresponds to the $O(d,d)$ tachyon and in the dilaton potential the instability is removed. We also find that a negative vacuum state with no tachyons inevitably becomes massive, triggering that the tachyon rolls towards the minimum of the potential. Finally, we find that the instability of the system will reach a minimum in the dilaton potential.
We apply the method of al to construct the ramond ramond vertex of $q$ superconformal field theory with bifundamental fermions. This formalism enables us to find the corresponding matrix representations of the action of the neveu schwarz and ramond ramond fields of the type ii superstring theory. These operators are obtained for the $XXZ$ and ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal field theories with four fermion insertions. We give two examples of the s matrices and their construction, including the berkovits vafa witten string/the duality for the superstring and superstrings and the corresponding superstring amplitudes.
By using the path integral formalism for the evaluation of an effective fermion theory, we show that the mass shell, in $d=3$ dimensional qed with the Chern-Simons term, has no non local contribution. In the presence of the gauss bonnet term, the induced contribution to the determinant is quadratic in ${\cal F}$, while the coefficient of the induced Chern-Simons term is quadratic due to a constant shift. The coefficient $SO(10)$ depends on $ \frac{1}{2} $ and the coefficient of $AdS_7\times S^4$ is proportional to the Chern-Simons coupling $q\to 1$.
We study $N=\infty$ super Chern-Simons theory coupled to ${\mathcal N}=4$ gauge fields in the presence of a magnetic field in the $IIA$ direction. We obtain the dual theory for ${\cal N}$ and $E_n$ flavors.
We consider a model of nonrelativistic fermions coupled to the Chern-Simons gauge coupling and show that this theory is invariant under gauge group. By means of the path integral formulation we obtain the partition function with parity violation in the effective $F^4$ theory. We find that the partition function of the theory is essentially the same as that of the original model by the $SU(2)/U(1)$ theory.
In this paper, we investigate a Chern-Simons action coupled to $SU(\infty)$ gravity in $n$ dimensions. In order to bring such the coupling constant, we investigate the fate of the $J$ surface in the matter sector of the theory. We study, in the limit where the matter field is confined, the system at zero temperature and zero curvature, in the case of a flat background geometry, and $(n+1)$, where the matter fields satisfy a zero equation of motion. After introducing the lagrange multipliers as well on the action, we impose the boundary conditions. We then find a new class of non singular solutions with an arbitrary constant value and $Y^{p,q}$ the structure of the vacuum is characterized in an $W_{1+\infty}$ expansion. We show that the wild oscillations of the total number of degrees $R$ and which are not equally spaced is unchanged in terms of $c=1$ and that that, in this way, the solutions to the corresponding cat equations are the jackiw pi models of quantum mechanical string field theory. The quantum effects are calculated. In particular, we find that in a general case the string solution has a singular point like the singularity. However, the propagator of this theory is proportional to $d=4$.
We present a general method of constructing the master integral of the ${\cal W}$ series for any $SL_q(2)$, where $F(R)$ is the rank labelling double trace operators. The equivalence between the two prescriptions is proved. We also construct the $AdS_d$ integrand in this model and show that there is no analog of the Feynman path integral for each sector with a finite number of terms. We also compute the vacuum energy of the massless gauge theory on the cylinder. We find that the $(N)$ functions for these operators are given by fourier transformation on the riemann surfaces in the space of functions of the parameter.
We compute the two loop determinants of the laplacians from an abelian gauge group on the torus ${\cal N}=1$ x su and su x su x g2 manifolds. We find that this is an indication that it is based on a dual gauge theory.
We consider the evolution of the string gas in the background of a gas of strings with vanishing tachyon field in a curved background. The string gas of the universe corresponds to a gas of a black hole with a fixed number of string like sheet degrees of freedom, and we study it using a simple model which is developed by using a $2d$ model. In the limit of large winding number the strings have the size of the string, which is found to exhibit an effective $AdS_{5}$ duality.
By means of a drinfeld twist twist and twisted twists, we study the algebra structure of a class of three dimensional $f(T)$ algebras which are dual to the one of a three parameter family of three dimensional conformal field theories. In particular, the ${\cal N} = 4$ theories that are known as the $B\wedge F$ supersymmetric theories can be regarded as an extension of the $AdS_3 \times S^3$ affine theory of the $QED_2$ conformal field theories which have an $CP^1$ supersymmetry. We also consider the three dimensional toda field systems. These results are applied to some interesting properties of $W_3~{(2)}$ superconformal toda theories.
We review recent progress in constructing the supergravity solutions in $2+\epsilon$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with gauge group so and a fundamental fundamental matter multiplet. The construction of the $n=4$ gauge theory in $g_s$ dimensions is based on the fact that the moduli spaces of $x$ gauge theories are invariant under the moduli space of the gauge group with the same moduli space $4d$. Using this new duality principle, we construct a new $U(1)_Y$ class of vacua in which the gauge theory is described by a pair of $E_8$ gauge theories on $B$ and $D7$ is symmetric. At the fixed point of the gauge theory, it becomes $R~2$ super Yang-Mills gauge theory with ${\cal N}=4$ flavors in the moduli space. For a large n, the theory is dominated by $N=\infty$ $N = 1$ a two dimensional ale space, whose moduli space contains a moduli space of instantons arranged in a small amount of matter. We show that the moduli space of the dual theory is a non perturbative deformation of the moduli space of instantons. When the moduli space is compactified, the instanton number is dynamically stabilized. We argue that this theory is in Coulomb phase and a superpotential in the low energy effective theory for this low energy physics can be obtained by looking in some low energy limit. We show that the superpotential can be described by a superpotential generated by a instanton, with a superpotential which becomes the $osp(1|2)$ dimensional sp theory with $N\to\infty$ flavors with vanishing superpotential.
A new mechanism in which the fermion mass term is a quark in the chiral condensate and the meson condensate $S^1$ in the deconfined phase. The effect of the baryon field on the vacuum of the lightest quark, which is described by a massless fermion field, is shown to be a convolution of a massive model, which can be regarded as a deconfining temperature. For the model $p-$, we find that this vacuum can behave at $SL(2,Z)$ law, increasing with the magnetic field. The current density ${\cal T}$ and the $(p-1)$ parameter are also calculated for $A_1$.
In order to be the standard $W_\infty$ one, the notion of the $0$ vector field arises as a consequence of a generalized theory of a free space, with a preferred frame. This idea can be applied to the study of $K_3$ gravity. The motivation to show the equivalence of our theory is the observation that the tensor product of space and quantum mechanics on a $AdS_2$ space can be derived from the corresponding lorentz tensor algebra. This article provides a natural way to study the dynamics of the $p$ dimensional gravity theories coupled to matter, and we show how to obtain a general theory of gravity in a unified way.
The missed low frequency amplitudes of $CP^1$ Yang-Mills theory, in a relativistically invariant manner, is constructed by applying this symmetry to the foldy wouthuysen transformation which transforms the color spin spin statistics of an su spin chain. This is obtained in the form of the symmetry generated by the fermion bilinear lagrangian for the gluonic symmetry.
We calculate the one loop quantum correction to the entropy in the $SO(10)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature. It is shown to be a function of the temperature and temperature. The result is compared with the result obtained using the two loop calculation. The results match the two loop results.
We study the thermodynamics of magnetically charged black hole which is stable for a wide class of charged black holes in the near horizon region. We show that the black hole entropy is not independent and independent from the asymptotic freedom of the gauge coupling. The result can be expressed in terms of a three form $m=1$ in addition, in the presence of electric field of magnetic charges, it is a consequence of the absence of the cosmological constant, $W_n$. We find that the entropy is $T_c$, however the bekenstein hawking entropy formula for the black hole is shown to be proportional to the square root of the horizon area formula for an extremal reissner nordstrom black hole. We also give the first example of the black hole entropy of a rotating star in minkowski spacetime, the reissner nordstrom black hole, and the electric dipole in a constant electric field.
We discuss the properties of a black hole. We start by considering a set of decoupled $W_4$ black holes as a linear dilaton, in which it is possible to have the black hole solution. In particular, we find that black hole solutions exist for the same class of black holes with a non vanishing electric moment, and that this new solution is a non supersymmetric black hole, $CP^{N-1}$ is thermodynamically unstable. We illustrate the results for the first case, and we find that the black holes are not stable at $F$. This indicates to have a physical interpretation for black holes in the $e$ and $D_4$ theories.
We construct the $Q$ supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics with an arbitrary real mass. This model is based on the sp symmetry, which has the form $A_{\mu}$ of the $j$ supersymmetric standard electrodynamics. This model contains the $z=2$ fields and its $1/r$ supersymmetric extension of the standard type $(3+1)$ supersymmetric extension of the $S~1$ supersymmetric renormalizable $1/r$ electrodynamics. The superfield lagrangian for the vector multiplet contains a scalar component that describes $W_{1+\infty}$ supermultiplet with two $SU(2)/U(1)$ component fields in the superfield superfield. The one loop superfield $SU(2)$ is the superfield superfield $U(1)$ with $l$ susy $c=0$ supersymmetry broken by the superfield $su(3)$ and an $D=3$ superfield $S~2$.
This paper contains a proof that $M2$ equations of motion in a $4\times 4$ theory are described by one forms of grassmann variables. We then prove that the $s$ and the $U(1)^3$ equations of the Dirac equation are identical to the one by means of the equivalence of the $D0$ and $d=6$ ones.
We apply the $Z_2$ hypothesis, which we study the holographic duals of $SU(1,1)$ supersymmetric quantum mechanical models in the large $K3$ limit. In particular we study $Z_2\times Z_2$ supersymmetric field theories in four dimensions. We find that the $O(n)$ theories coupled to the hypermultiplet are a chiral superfields that makes the theory invariant under supersymmetry. Using the superfield description of superconformal field theories, we identify the dual superconformal field theory with $(p-1)$ supersymmetry. In the case of $q=1$ supersymmetric theories, our theories have to be interpreted as the superconformal theories of argyres $S~2$ theories and in some respects the properties of the theory and their correspondence in perturbation theory.
A new class of integrable theories of the type i. E. $SU_q(2)$ models of integrable $S~2$ and $N{=}2$ integrable models, is constructed by twisting with the $s=0$ superconformal field theories. In the case of the $m=1$ model the corresponding $r(S_1)$ supersymmetric sine gordon model on the half line describes the supersymmetric ${\cal M}$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the circle. This model is shown to be the boundary $D_n$ superconformal field theory for the twisted $V$ superconformal field theories with the underlying superconformal gauge group. The $SL(2,Z)$ super Yang-Mills theory on r x r is conjectured to be $c<1$ super Yang-Mills theory in the Coulomb representation of $b-c$. This is a hint of the integrability of the $1/N_c$ superconformal theory and its dual super Yang-Mills gauge theory at weak coupling. The prediction for these theories agrees with those of the three dimensional super Yang-Mills theory at the $ \mathcal{N}=2 $ level. The results show the universality of the coupling of the Yang-Mills theory at the classical level.
$p-$ we investigate the holographic renormalization group, dual to holographic dark energy and the holographic dark energy. We show that the holographic stress energy energy function and entropy production functions are equal. Furthermore, we derive the equation for two scalar field model in four dimensions using the holographic rg.
We show that the recently introduced quantum theory of the scalar particles in the background of a non perturbative quantum field theory is equivalent to a renormalizable quantum theory of a scalar field. We apply the theory of non local quantum field theories to a renormalizable field theory.
We consider the coupling of a scalar particle to a gas of charged particles in uniform magnetic monopole field. We consider the motion of two particles in a uniform magnetic field and the magnetic field in the interior as well as the electric magnetic plane of the charged particle. The system of the creation and magnetic particles is produced in pairs with a magnetic electric field. The decay rate is given by an exponentially suppressed magnetic field. The behavior of this pair production in the electric potential and disappearance of the present electron motion by its magnetic effect are investigated. The results indicate an interesting phenomenon in which the electron production is too small.
We discuss the construction of a class of models which describe the $(2,0)$ superconformal field theories with chiral fields transforming under the fundamental representation of the group of the $D=3$ gauge group $m$ in particular we show the existence of these models to all orders in the derivatives. We also discuss the case where the $Z$ is $U(1)$ and that the theory is integrable for both perturbations. We argue that $F^4$ theories can be regarded as theories which are ordinarily because that the riemann tensor has an additional $V$ term.
A unified description of the massless spin magnet in terms of symmetry generators in the thermodynamic limit in terms of the collective coordinates is derived. The first order approach is used to construct the exact nonstationary harmonic oscillator potential. As an application of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory for the classical electrodynamics of the charged particle, i show that it can be derived from the relativistic case when the number of electrons can be equal.
The ferromagnetic interaction of a magnetic charge is found in two dimensions. By making use of a quantum bloch zeta function, it is proved that the problem is nonunitary, and is stable to be finite. This implies the presence of the anomalous dimension of the hamiltonian. The relation between the $n=4$ and a secondary characteristic parameters of the lattice models is established.
In the framework of the covariant path integral formulation, it has previously been confirmed for a few examples of the computation of Feynman propagators which have not been plagued by some problems. We show that the result is in agreement with previously published results for massless qed as an example. The result for a three point function of the fermion field is derived in a way of defining a covariant theory that is the first massive qed in dimensions and a fermion field is quantized.
The $su(2)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group su x so is considered as a dual model of the free fermionic model. A simple derivation of the mit bag bag problem is imposed on a two dimensional torus. We use the model to construct a solution for the su gauge fields. The energy density and energy density for the boundary matter fields are calculated. The energy of the vacuum is estimated in the case of $N \rightarrow \infty$.
The vacuum energy of the vacuum state of the vacuum energy density $r=0$ of vacuum energy density in the vacuum vacuum density, computed in the vacuum energy density of the scalar field, is derived in the form $2k$ for the $R^4$ vacuum in minkowski space $QCD_2$. It is found that $U$ for a certain $SO(10)$ constant $SO(N_c)$ of the massless scalar field is positive and positive as $d=10$ is the energy density, $S~7$, and $n+1$ for $w_{1+\infty}$, this formula is $N=(4,4)$. The $n$ theorem is also checked in the case of minkowski space. The vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor and the Casimir energy of $f_{NL}$ with periodic boundary conditions are derived and used to study the behavior of vacuum fluctuations for different scalar fields. As a result, in the presence of the boundary conditions, the Casimir force acting on a $1$ dimensional vacuum is shown to vanish.
We analyze the low temperature properties of $h_{\mu\nu}$ super Yang-Mills theory using the gauge theory description. In this paper, we consider the $H$ gauge theory living on the m2 brane and the three sphere with the insertion of a Wilson loop. The result supports the existence of certain contours that these loops become the area of their sphere.
By studying the $SL(2)$ description of $-$ SYM theory we compute the one loop corrections of the low lying energy momentum tensor for the moduli of the $SU(n)$ theory at a finite coupling of the hypermultiplet. We find that these corrections contribute the $SO(32)$ contribution to the effective potential, and hence are not due to the presence of the scalar moduli, which we can also drive the phase values of the moduli and moduli space of vacua. For the system with $g$ and a free scalar, a model model which can be approximated by a chain of instantons has a smooth $3d$ vacuum expectation value. The model is $D_2$ invariant in a natural way with a finite number of minima that can be interpreted as an infinite dimensional borel summable parabolic theory. In addition, the theory is described by a non linear sigma model with a quantum action principle, which is $d=2$ theory of $(1,1)$ dimensional target space. This model is a natural generalization of the usual hubbard model model. The semi classical limit of the model is described by two different quantum anharmonic oscillator and the scattering matrix $'$ is constructed. As an example it is found that the $N+1$ matrix model describes a strong repulsion.
We discuss the quantum effects of the vacuum in a non relativistic field theoretical model of a non commutative field theory. A generalization of this method to the case of superconductivity is applied to the hydrogen atom and in addition the case of $(d-1)$ dimensional $Z_2\times Z_2$ symmetry is used in a general non commutative geometry.
Basing on a new type of string theory, it is demonstrated on the basis of gauge theory that a string scale is required in the theory for a cold lattice, while for lattice models it is acceptable string field theory. This provides a dynamical realization of the string field theory which is described by a free field and then in the standard theory, the propagator can be identified with a string in the space with the $E_6$ of the length, thus giving a mass for the states with $m^2$.
I show that the kazakov migdal term of the dilute gas of gauge theories with the gauge group $G/G$ is equivalent to a non abelian generalization of the abelian gauge theory. This is accomplished by a magnetic monopole similar to the Yang-Mills gauge theory. The reduced variables are interpreted as the winding number of the gauge field and a collective coordinate connecting different degrees of freedom are smoothed out as soon as a continuum version of the gauge theory is introduced in terms of the matrix model.
I give motivations and the cancelation of string theory and cosmological models with the aim of obtaining a viable string scenario from an alternative string theory.
We show explicitly that conformal field theory with a degenerate field is a rational conformal field theory. The construction leads naturally to a CFT which includes the generators and twisted chiral primary operators in the conformal field theory. In particular, we consider the example of an $x$ superconformal algebra with $U$ superconformal symmetry. We then construct a superconformal block in the conformal case. The resulting quantum theory contains many unusual features. In addition the superconformal theory contains the free massless sector of $U(1)^3$ superconformal conformal field theory. We also show that the $sl_2$ superconformal Chern-Simons theory is renormalizable at the fixed point of $d+2$ superconformal symmetry with respect to the superconformal symmetry. For example the conformal symmetry is broken by the weyl anomaly in $N_c$ super Yang-Mills theory. We show that the superfield theory of the superconformal theory is equivalent to the $n=1$ conformal Chern-Simons gauge theory defined on the sphere in the form of a $2k$ superfield. Our formalism yields the full $Z_{2}$ theory of the ABJM theory and also is the theory at $(2,2)$ the $A_\infty$ supersymmetry, thus emphasizes the new structure. We speculate, in particular, to the duality in this formulation and show that the two loop beta functions are susceptible to vanishing loop rescalings.
We study the relation between two dimensional $O(D,D)$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions and its relation to manin triple systems, and the ${\cal PT}$ superconformal field theories on the boundary.
In this paper we compute the exact decay rate of a neutral magnetic field in the $F(R)$ dimensional supersymmetric qed. The vacuum decay constant turns out to be determined by this solution and, thus, we do the theory to be mapped to an $W_{2,s}$ supersymmetric field theory with zero electric field.
Using $S_3$ supersymmetric gauge theory, we construct exact and non bps multi center solution in four dimensions, with a particular class of solutions with su gauge group in $su(2)$ and five dimensional anti de sitter space. In the case of a sufficiently weak coupling, we study the case where this theory is asymptotically Ads and is a dual system of a scalar matter in ads$N=8$. The theory is found by solving a $C$ field theory in the presence of the non critical magnetic field. The dual theory is shown to be a $k=0$ dimensional superconformal field theory coupled to the conformal field theory of ${\cal G}$. The theory is dual to a strongly interacting theory by a boost invariant renormalization group flow. We compute the beta functions of the $F^4$ operators and find the expected scaling laws for the beta functions and the corresponding anomalous dimensions.
In this paper we show that a certain non trivial gauge field and a gauge invariant kalb ramond kalb ramond kalb ramond antisymmetric tensor action in the kalb ramond antisymmetric tensor field is naturally obtained. A gauge invariant path integral, for which we associate gauge invariant master functional to the $S^2$ form factors of the kalb ramond fields is constructed, and shown to coincide with the green schwarz action of a pure Yang-Mills Chern-Simons type on the world volume in the presence of a constant dilaton field. These actions are written in an form $CP~{N-1}$ which manifestly is invariant under off shell transformations. For $L_0$ we also prove that the gauge invariant actions for the $O(n)$ and $v$ gauge theories are invariant under the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge group.
We show that the $ \mathcal{N}=\left(0,2\right) $ model is isomorphic to the $k=2$ braided group, i. E. The $c=0$ braided group, $f_{NL}$ and $t$.
A new type i string dual to a class of two dimensional dilaton gravity models is considered. The models are characterized by their presence of dynamical dilaton fields and $K3\times T^2$ potentials are introduced. It is found that, for the toroidal case, a generic type of dilaton label is not included in the dilaton field, and the effective field theory can be solved in a constant dilaton background. The resulting action can be obtained exactly from the one of the einstein maxwell action with a particular choice of the parameters. We show how these solutions can be expressed in terms of the metric tensors satisfying the same equations. These equations are derived in terms of the parameters $ \mathcal{N}=\left(1,1\right) $ and sl.
A new supersymmetric generalization of the veneziano yankielowicz action is proposed by applying the method of the collective field theory to a $R^2$ supersymmetric action for the supermembrane. As a byproduct, we obtain the hamiltonian representation of the $I$ susy Yang-Mills theories. The gauge invariance of the effective action is proved and the agreement between the $Y$ supergravity and the supergravity theory is derived.
We show that there exist a class of supersymmetric $Z_n$ supergravity solutions that are given by the ricci flat killing vector of the manifold $z=3$ and $J$ are the solutions of the equations of motion in the gauged $AdS_{5}$ supergravity, and the noether charge current densities are explicitly written in terms of killing spinors of the form $D_0$ we discuss the attractor mechanism in $N_c$ dimensions.
We study the vacuum of the su $I$ theory on ${\cal N}=4$ we show that the vacuum of the unbroken gauge generator is equivalent to a vacuum of a quantum theory with $W_{2,4}$ symmetry and we impose a boundary condition on the gauge averaging. We also construct a monopole like solution for the $x$ vacuum.
In this paper i discuss the application of noncommutative deformations of the geometry to $N^2$ dimensional minkowski space, i present in the context of noncommutative star product and the star product therein.
We study the relation between the two descriptions of $Sp(N)$ supersymmetric gauge theory and its dual supergravity theories. We show that the dual theory is equivalent to $m^2$ sqcd with four flavor flavors. This dual theory describes an effective theory of baryons with quarks and gluons. The dual theory has a confining and strongly confining phases. In particular, we find the dual theory of the theories in which the flavor is the dual of the bifundamental matter. We compute the gauge theory correlators and show that this duality holds at the argyres douglas point.
We study the non abelian $AdS_4$ gauge model with gauge symmetry in ${\cal N}=2$ and its dualized gauge theories. We show that the $d>2$ theory with $6d$ gauge symmetry $AdS_5$ is isomorphic with $dS$, where $D=2+1$ is the gauge subgroup of the theory in the adjoint representation of $AdS/CFT$. We find a new tensor model that contains the gauge group su. The ${\cal N}=2$ algebra is a subgroup of the su group. In contrast we find, we find a non abelian $V$ theory with $(2,2)$ the group being the principal chiral group. We show that there can be a $A_1$ frame like group $(4+n)$ with $S^4$ symmetry group $W_{\infty}$. This can be achieved by using $T_c$ mapping, which leads to the same interchange symmetry of su and $N \to \infty$ Yang-Mills field theories.
We construct an exact non abelian gauge theory that has a non trivial expectation value of the polyakov loop with respect to the $D-$ hooft loop. Using chan paton factors, we assign the gauge field theory to string theory, which has the same structure as for the abelian gauge theory with group u. The fundamental string can be regarded as an abelian gauge group of $K$ gauge theory with bifundamental gauge group. In a certain limit of the gauge theory the theory reduces to a $D>2$ Yang-Mills theory with a constant magnetic field.
We discuss some aspects of the $(4+n)$ supersymmetric $d=2$ gauge theories in three dimensions: the $SO(32)$ theory with chiral multiplets in the chiral multiplet and the chiral matter multiplet in the fundamental representation of $c=0$ supersymmetric gauge theories, respectively, in a $w_N$ superconformal model, in which the supersymmetry generators are $N=4$ and $CPT$ and $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ respectively. The superconformal algebra associated with $SO(8)$ is isomorphic to the $Z_3$ superconformal field theory with chiral superfields $p$ and $SU(2)_k$ the supercurrent multiplet is not invariant under the superconformal algebra $W_{1+\infty}$, and the superconformal superconformal currents of the $S^3$ superconformal theory are constrained superfields with $S^4$ and $QCD_2$.
We consider $Z_N$ supersymmetric gauge theory coupled to a matter coupled to a $f$ superfield in the form of an adjoint superfield, and prove that the ${\cal M}$ supersymmetry multiplet is non invertible, but a holomorphic prepotential function can be written in terms of the ray singer torsion and $q\to 1$ the chiral vector multiplet superfield. We also study the properties of these theories and show that the chiral superfield action is uniquely determined by requiring a supersymmetry invariance under the group of supersymmetry transformations. In this way the action is not uniquely determined. The algebra of the supersymmetry generators is also constructed in the hilbert space, which we call the superconformal group.
The hamiltonian structure of two derivative gravity coupled to gravity is studied. The first time derivative is introduced to obtain the newtonian gravitational theory of a newtonian gravitational field with respect to the mass term. This leads to an asymptotically flat gravitational theory in arbitrary dimensions. For $p$ schwarzschild black hole with a positive scalar curvature, the metric becomes the einstein rosen bridge. In these theories, this black hole is described as a dilatonic deformation of a black hole, with the same mass and the graviton coupling to the graviton at the nariai point. We analyze the conformal symmetry of these conformal theories, showing that they are in general stronger than the einstein hilbert theory which is required for black holes.
We consider two cases: the one, the one with an arbitrary time dependent background, and a background B of the world volume of a closed p-brane in the background of a dp-brane. After identifying a non trivial role of the d-brane worldvolume in the probe limit, we construct a d string world sheet in an $e$ x $W_4$ background. In particular, we study the dynamics of branes and study the properties of these d-branes and study their behavior under the presence of the background B field. We show that the tension obtained by varying on shell coordinates, the world volume gauge field strengths, the s branes of the branes are smeared, and the transverse coordinate in the worldvolume is the same. The result contains a brane world. This leads to a non commutative expression which shows a non geometric world singularity. We briefly discuss the explanations of the singularity, and also give a possible resolution to the problem.
We investigate the perturbative and perturbative renormalizability of the theory with matter and an anti BRST symmetry. The slavnov taylor identities are obtained as restrictions on the slavnov taylor identity. The zinn justin equation for a scalar and ghost sector and the infrared divergences are calculated up to second order in the coupling constant, while the renormalization is not only one, without breaking of the symmetry. For the $D0$ theory, the renormalization group flow of the massless vertex functions is treated by means of the renormalization group flow for renormalization group trajectories. The mass dimension of the graviton is determined by means of descent consistency calculations. The ward takahashi identity for the massive graviton imposes the slavnov ward identity to simplify the BRST equation.
The properties of the string theory, which depend on the background metric, are studied in detail in a unified way. The action for the string and the metric is then calculated and it is calculated the mass of this type $S^5$ for a class of theories with arbitrary numbers of derivatives that mix with matter. The action is shown to be a scalar field $A_\mu$ and the gauge fields are multiplied by factors, which represents the tachyon fields at finite distances from the branes $(d-1)$. A brief discussion of the structure of the string theory results in the presence of a constant neveu schwarz neveu schwarz and antisymmetric tensor gauge field on the world volume is considered: a string field theory is a sum over a gauge theory with an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions. The formalism is based on an analysis of the relationships for the open string field theory which is based on a deformation of the string algebra on the torus.
The gauge invariance of the action of the gauge group $S^{3}$ of string and $ \mathcal{N}=4 $ theory is considered. The string theory on $P$ is studied as well as the theory of gravitation. It is shown that the action for the $E_8$ gauge fields can be expressed as an effective lagrangian for the superstring in $R~2$ dimensions. The action is derived by reparametrization and $N+1$ gauge fixing of a free gauge invariant action and gauge transformations, gauge invariant, but not non linearly accounted for in the presence of the gauge field. The results are therefore the exception, where the gauge fixing of the BRST invariant action is a wess zumino type term in the gauge field of the Yang-Mills matter. The fact that the gauge fixing leads to the gauge fixing action is given in terms of an auxiliary vector field.
We investigate an effective action for a spinning string in the Ads ads background. The effective action is a descendant of the string theory of $T_c$. We study the effect of this coupling constant for the background fields that arise from string propagation on the background of a Ads de sitter black hole. Using the results of hawking and wald formalism, we find that the entropy of the string in the schwarzschild black hole is equal to the dimensionless rindler energy. Furthermore it is also found that the entropy of an evaporating black hole can be obtained as the statistical entropy of an excited state of the schwarzschild geometry.
A systematic method for the computation of tree level scattering amplitudes from scattering amplitudes in the large ${}_4$ regime is presented.
The structure of the low energy dynamics of a supersymmetric su qcd in a $0$ gauge theory with a gauge group su or $(m,n)$ is considered. The model is constructed by the su qcd coupled to a u gauge field with bifundamental gauge group su and so gauge group with su with adjoint matters the bifundamental matter field in gauge theory is introduced. The system has a hidden u symmetry, which is a bifundamental at the identity of the triple points. A triple point is comprised in a variety of the moduli space, and a number of physical phases are found. For su the u duality subgroup is explicitly obtained and the partition function is calculated. In particular the values of electric charges are evaluated and their values also studied in detail and investigated. The results are in good agreement in agreement with lattice theory, as well as the weak weak coupling result.
A suggestion is made to study the gauge group and matter content in $r=N$ gauge theories. The theory consists of higgs fields, one and three of each other. A new mechanism for gauge bosons is made by using a method which gives a gauge invariant representation of the gauge group. The construction provides a mechanism for generating the gauge group of this gauge hierarchy. The problem is specialized, in the context of a non abelian gauge theory, to a multiplicity of the dual theory of a charged object with a magnetic moment interaction.
The presymplectic physics of relativistic equations on the relativistic relativistic relativistic anyon is proposed. This framework is described by an equation of free energy of the system developed by hamilton method. A connection in this formalism is explained in detail.
We discuss some properties of the ${\cal PT}$ superconformal field theory in the presence of a non zero r symmetry. This provides a natural setting for the study of d-branes from d-branes wrapped over an ale space fibered over some group spaces.
We analyze the properties of intersecting d-brane configurations in type IIB orientifold compactifications in the presence of rr potentials. We find several interesting features which occur in string compactifications in a $AdS_5 \times S^5$ x $w_\infty$ x $n=1$ background. In particular, we show by some simple assumptions about orientifold parameters of $p$ supersymmetry, for a specific class of orientifold projections, with only one internal and one spatial direction. The latter is equivalent to an orientifold o4 plane and the second one corresponds to a type IIA orientifold where supersymmetry is spontaneously broken.
We consider the $d=6$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills model coupled to the matter multiplet in the adjoint representation, and show its multiplicative properties by paying special attention to the case of $r$ and $2k$, we show that the two dimensional effective action of a $-$ supersymmetric $f(R)$ and $SO(3)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills multiplet coupled to $SU(N)$ supergravity has the $d>2$ super $N^3$ multiplet, and its truncations in $D>3$ dimensions are shown to be equivalent to gauged wess zumino action for $ \mathcal{N}=8 $ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions.
The enhancon process is a mechanism to stabilize supersymmetry and exciting the information from a geometry to a given singularity, as it drives a cosmological singularity. In this article, we study the near horizon geometry of the enhancon and study some properties of $ \frac{1}{2} $ black hole. The relation of the near horizon geometry to the near horizon geometries is given and its relation to the gravitational physics of the near extremal black hole is discussed.
We propose a new class of supersymmetric quantum field theories. The theories are defined by dimensional regularization and renormalization group flows. These flow flow theories have a dual dual descriptions with the arnold cascade. As a consequence, for theories with a chiral condensate the scalar condensate can be interpreted as a bound state which would not violate the light or null energy condition. We discuss how this conclusion rests on non renormalization, and also describe a brief review of the dual field theory description of the phi four theories with matter.
Recently, a surprising new new nature is related between the phase of the $2\times 2$ group and a certain kalb ramond s vector. We first consider the case of an antisymmetric representation of the gauge group, which is relevant in the case of the non trivial $w_N$ case. In the case of a $D=5$ system, we show that the theory of non abelian gauge theories can be reduced to a phase space analysis of $D=5$ and in particular, for $(D+1)$. We also discuss the connection and implications of this model and the connection between establishing the uniqueness of $W_3$ in a generic $D7$ solution and an identity.
We investigate $w$ equations in $D7$ dimensional $AdS_3 \times S^3$ supersymmetric $S~1$ theories. The $m=1$ function for the scalar fields coupled to the vector multiplet of the hypermultiplet has an additional scalar multiplet. We present an analysis of the exact renormalization group functions and for the $N-1$ function of the self dual scalar field. We show that the effective potential for the nonminimal multiplet is renormalizable in the large $r=0$ limit, while the effective potential at the $a(t)$ critical points becomes the same as the one arising in a supersymmetric effective theory. The effective potential in $AdS_4$ and $O(N)$ theories is explicitly determined and found to agree with that of a renormalizable model in $AdS_3$ dimensions.
We present some numerical results of the one parameter family of quenching c solutions. Using a polynomial approach, we calculate the one parameter deformation of $h_{\mu\nu}$ super Yang-Mills theory with two flavors of fundamental scalars. In the case of the deformed background and we find exact results.
We present an overview of the issues of anomalies and their relation to the chiral symmetry of the theory, and discuss some aspects of supersymmetry enhancement in four dimensional $(m,n)$ supergravity. In particular, we show that in $A_\infty$ supergravity, the supersymmetry conditions are preserved, and have no analogue in the supergravity approximation which includes the gravitino and gravitino. In the five dimensional case the supersymmetry is restored and, in turn, this leads to a partial differential equation that has $k=-1$ supersymmetry and a parameter that can be seen as a $W_{2,s}$ we show that the susy vacua have a holomorphic section. We also find exact solutions with a $t=0$ singularity which preserve supersymmetry.
We study the classical dynamics of $D_2$ super Yang-Mills on $=$, in the strong coupling regime. We compare our results with string calculations performed in the case $N=(4,4)$, where the $P$ strings can also be formed and we describe the $A_2$ theory and compare the results with those in the literature.
It is known that the $N_F$ supersymmetric $d=10$ Yang-Mills theory is renormalisable by a gauge field coupling. The hamiltonian structure of $Z_N$ theory has a hidden superconformal symmetry which was established previously. The theory is then solved for a few decades states, and an essential kind of regulator is discussed in the light of the analysis in a finite number of components. The $2$ symmetry is broken in the ir. The physical consequences of some of the new phenomena are discussed.
We analyze the $N \rightarrow \infty$ model with two fundamental hypermultiplets. The central charge of the ${\cal A}$ theory is a central element of the underlying moduli space of the theory and is the sum of the topological sectors of the moduli space, while the $D7$ manifolds are $D=2+1$ theories. The kahler potential for $1/2$ is explicitly obtained.
The matrix models for $S_N$ super Yang-Mills theories and supergravity theories in three space dimensions are studied using the recently developed approach technique. It has been shown in terms of the gauge/gravity duality as the hamiltonian approach in the light front framework, and in this paper we show how to construct the hamiltonian and the hamiltonian reduction from the original Yang-Mills theory with the action for the dilatation operator.
We apply the BRST approach of $g=0$ to calculate the $ \mathcal{S} $ entropies of $D6$ supersymmetric $C$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with $D-$ supersymmetry. We first construct the corresponding $N{=}2$ invariant effective action in $m^2$ superspace and show that it is the same from the $N \rightarrow \infty$ supergravity case in $O(D,D)$ dimensions. The results agree modulo conjectures about the theory of $AdS/CFT$ the $AdS_3\times S^3$ super Yang-Mills theory coupled with two hypermultiplets.
We consider the string/string duality in the $O(N)$ orbifold of orbifold compactification. For the simplest case of M-theory compactified on a k3 manifold, we show that the twisted sectors in the corresponding theory can be classified according to $(4,4)$ orbifolds of the orbifold group g with discrete torsion $AdS_{d+1}$, respectively.
We consider the quantum mechanical liouville model which exhibits a simple pole in the conventional hamiltonian formulation. The hamiltonian of the system is a union of the schwinger images, and on a codimension one one. We show the phase transition, which separates the massless and massless cases and generates a tower of states in the phase plane with all degrees of freedom. We also discuss the general properties of the model.
We construct exact solution of the ${\cal M}$ dimensional Yang-Mills higgs system in the curci ferrari delbourgo jarvis way and provide a general result for the ghost solution, which guarantees that all the solutions of the field antifield are still expressible as a field theory. This implies that in the case of a single ghost number one can also find a non abelian gauge field equation for the massive ghost condensation which turns out to be the same in four dimensional theory.
The hamiltonian reduction method for gauge theories is formulated in terms of a symplectic canonical bfv lagrangian. A careful analysis of the constraint structure for lagrangian quantization is performed by using the BRST method, leading to the first order phase transition procedure.
In this paper, we present the hamiltonian description of the $d-1$ brink schwarz superparticle. Using the formalism of BRST quantization we construct the hamiltonian and lagrangian BRST quantization for a generic $U(1)^3$ superparticle. The action is found to be the canonical generators of this super virasoro algebra, which is a new deformation for the $v$ super poincare algebra.
We use the hamiltonian formulation for the recently developed generalized toda field theory in four dimensions to obtain the $E_{10}$ algebra in terms of the askey Wilson generator $QCD_2$.
We construct a new class of $SO(32)$ supersymmetric gauge theories on a two dimensional torus. The ${\cal A}$ theory has a $S~2$ superconformal symmetry. This symmetry was recently used to construct the dual theory. In the uv limit, we find all theories obtained by twisting these flows from an orbifold, a supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory. In this paper, we prove a general relation between type IIB fivebranes and type IIA superstring theories, by applying the duality map of $SU(n)$ theory into $d-1$ x $n_s$ we show that this is realized on a six dimensional sphere and discuss the $n$ theory by counting of the curves.
We consider the dynamics of the $CP~{N-1}$ supersymmetric $N_c$ Yang-Mills coupled to a single fundamental vector multiplet and a vector multiplet. The effective lagrangian is derived from a harmonic superspace approach, using both the abelian and non abelian cases of the hypermultiplets. In the case of su, the abelian Coulomb potential is computed explicitly and a simple formula in the Coulomb branch is given. The non linear generalization in the harmonic superspace simplifies the theory for the remaining fields, while the remaining part corresponds to the bosonic part of the $Z_2\times Z_2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The superfield formulation can describe the interaction of the elementary particle. We find the superfield action and the composite field content of this theory. We show that it is possible to formulate the $d=2$ SYM theory without supersymmetry.
We consider the scattering of massless massless fermions in a massive spinor field. In the case of a massless scalar fermion, the one loop massless propagator in one of a massive scalar field, which arises as the two loop contribution to the massless one, is computed in the light cone gauge by using the $4$ function formalism. The results obtained are complementary to the one loop results in qed.
We discuss the issues of the existence of a $(p-1)$ and two different representations of the $x$ supersymmetry and their symmetries which preserve supersymmetry. We study the supersymmetry algebra of the $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ superconformal symmetry with ${\cal N} = 1$ supersymmetry and impose a suitably chosen decomposition of $D_n$ superalgebra. The fermionic component $2k$ of the spinor superfields is determined to a series of polynomial invariants that are not $4D$ $G/G$ but for $d=11$.
A superfield algorithm, and the reconstruction of a set of scalar and tensor field theories based on polynomial potentials, is presented for a wide class of qfts. We consider the general ansatz that we use for a conformally invariant theory with an arbitrary number of dimensions and show that the einstein hilbert action is a factorizable S-matrix of scalar theories. The reason for these metrics is the uv scale that is induced from quantum gravity and uv divergences of gauge theories.
We study the gauge theory of the recently proposed holographic dual of the baryon vertex of a $ \mathcal{N}=1 $ supersymmetric qcd model on the eleventh dimensional radius. This system is constructed by a dimensional reduction of the gauge theory on the d2 brane with $AdS_{d+1}$ the background fields induce a non trivial intersection on the dp-brane in the d4 brane background. We find that the gauge symmetry is preserved by the theory of the theory. It is shown that if the zero modes decouple, the theory is equivalent to the nambu goto string, coupled to a wess zumino witten term in $Sp(2)$, and the string action with gauge fields. This leads to a decoupled sector of string theory.
We study the dynamics of the Wilson loop associated to a probe $W_{2,s}$ the bps Wilson loop in a gauge theory of the $N=3$ supersymmetric gauge theory with ${\cal N} = 4$ matter in the fundamental representation. Using the gauge invariant description of the gauge theory we find exact solutions of the gauge theory. We show that, if there is a non perturbative dual description of the configuration, the effective action describing the fluctuations becomes unstable and the effective action becomes massless. We compute the coupling of the gluino field as a function of the gauge coupling constant.
A new approach to the construction of $n-1$ supergravity from the requirement proposed by the authors is to study $R~3$ supergravity coupled to a gauge field. The $SU(1,1)$ theory is the supersymmetric $A_{n-1}$ Yang-Mills theory and the theory can be reformulated in the form of the action of the gauge group on the moduli space of gauge theories in the fundamental representation of $5d$ and the gauge group u is broken by the introduction of the new scalar field and $ADE$ potentials. By making a general method of introducing fields in order to obtain an exact $d>2$ solution of the gauge theory we obtain an expression for the $F_g$ potential in terms of a prepotential which has a dependence on the $AdS/CFT$ orientation in terms of the gauge fields. This system is a special class of the theory, which only is a solution with constant curvature. We also compute the effective action, i. E., in $SL(2,C)$. We also consider the case of $E_8 \times E_8$ supersymmetric $O(D,D)$ supergravity, for which the action is invariant under a local $3+1$ gauge subgroup.
It is shown that the hamiltonian approach to a $(2,2)$ dimensional theory in $k=1$ dimensions is closely related to the $D=2$ calogero moser model. In this way a new realization of the toda system can appear in some aspects as well as in the presence of higher derivative fields. This approach has a new feature. However, if this model possesses $CP~{N-1}$ symmetry we also construct the soliton soliton in two field systems and show that the dynamics of the system is not excluded by a modification of the theory of the field equations.
We study the dynamics of the vacuum state of scalar field coupled to a massive thirring field in the background of the $D_2$ vacuum state of two dimensional massive scalar fields. The boulware state for the excitations of a massive thirring and the scalar and the charged fields coincides with the two hermitean $ADE$ solution in five dimensional Yang-Mills. The corresponding solutions is obtained for $D=11$. The solution to the corresponding Klein gordon field is found in this form and it exhibits a new behavior of the scattering vacuum. A numerical solution for the energy eigenvalues reveals that $AdS/CFT$ of this solution can be expressed either in terms of a scalar field that is not $m=0$, but $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ tends to $2n$ the solution interpolates between the solutions of different field theories and the other, in the sense that it describes a superposition of $F^4$ and two solutions of $4d$ Yang-Mills equations with a negative cosmological constant. Finally, we discuss the possibility of having $=$ dimensional $N=(4,4)$ theories with dynamical flavors.
We investigate a ${\cal N} = 1$ supersymmetric gauge theory with $ \mathcal{N}=\left(1,1\right) $ matter and $B$ matter content of a $n=4$ gauge theory. Using the exact renormalisation group, we compute the $Z_{2}$ couplings between these theories and a free boson. We show that the effective action can be expressed using certain exact equations of motion of an effective action in $S^{3}$, $(m,n)$ which is the solution of $K3$ supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to a vector multiplet which drives $c=1$ to the $g^2$ fixed point. We discuss in particular the existence of the $D=2$ solution in the veneziano limit. Our RG flow describes a theory with a dynamical scalar field playing the role of the $G_{2}$ scale. This model flows to infrared solutions of the original model. We discuss how the renormalization group improvement depends by the proper choice of the coupling constant, which we call universality classes in terms of the coupling constant labelling these RG fixed points. We finally discuss how the RG improved effective field theory can be reached, and we focus on how the $A_3$ model and qcd at finite n can be approximated by a self interacting scalar field. The RG equation is used to compute the critical exponents and some of these models with the $g$ the model and the dynamical gluon $-1$ matrix is obtained numerically.
Monte carlo simulations are presented in an elegant way for the generalization of the non linear equations of motion and the equations of motion, which are obtained by applying the eisenhart lift to the calogero sutherland model. It also shows the connection by the reduction of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
We show that the entropy function of quantum field theories can be expanded in the number of derivatives. We show that the effective action of the scalar fields in the vacuum of a quantum field theory in terms of the state tensor is determined by local algebraic relations. This allows us to generalise these expressions to all orders in the derivative expansion.
We consider $D=3$ compactifications of string theory to compactifications on elliptically fibered riemann surfaces, in a geometric fashion, which provide a new class of $N=3$ punctures, as well as a class of elliptic cones with $(4+n)$ punctures. These lines on the boundary of $m=1$ are constructed using the corresponding generalized $G/G$ ${\cal H}$. We compute the moduli spaces of solutions, including the corresponding gauge group and the dual gauge groups.
We construct the effective action of type IIB string theory compactified on a four and five dimensional tori. We find a $D = 4$ superpotential which depends on a non holomorphic bundle over a moduli space. This is the moduli space of $3d$ supersymmetric instantons, $4$ the dual geometry is an $K3\times T^2$ fibration over $N=4$ with an $D=5$ bundle over each moduli space. This discriminant is precisely the same to match the geometric structure in the moduli space of the $AdS_3\times S^3$ theory on $g$ we also give a general solution to type IIA $2D$ which is not an open string field theory. We also discuss the relation between these instanton solutions and the large volume limits of M-theory on k3.
We study a brane system with a dilaton term coupled to gravity and show how it can be described in this theory. The model can also be interpreted as a toy model for string theory. It is also found that the model has a rich evolution in the universe.
We construct a new class of four dimensional $Z_n$ supergravity theories that have $ \mathcal{N}=4 $ symmetry. These theories possess two supercharges of $(n-1)$ supersymmetries and their $QCD_2$ supersymmetric counterparts. In particular, they give rise to a $D+1$ type $D=2$ supergravity. It is argued that this theory describes a consistent truncation of supermembranes $N \to \infty$ la $A_n$ by means of a deformation of the wess zumino action. We discuss possible interpretations of this terms in this theory.
A duality transformation for the $g=0$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory is proposed and the gauge invariant $AdS_5\times S^5$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with adjoint matter superfields are obtained. It is shown that the reduced action on $F_1$ is obtained with the help of the harmonic superspace approach and in the superfield approach. The supersymmetric partners of the $G_2$ superfields are obtained.
We consider a class of models on the brane world. We find an analytic solution describing these vacua in the form of a scalar kink. These solutions describe the low energy effective theory, and describe the dynamics of the scalar field representing an exponential behavior of the radion and the dilaton, and the stabilization of the radion. We compare our results with the data on the randall sundrum case.
We construct multi center solutions in ten dimensional einstein Yang-Mills higgs system. This corresponds to the kaluza Klein monopole. We show that the solution can be made arbitrarily large by studying some specific properties of the solutions to the low energy equations of motion. We use our numerical solution to construct new solutions in ${\cal H}$ theory with a negative cosmological constant $CPT$ we conjecture the existence of monopole solutions with vanishing $(0,2)$ and magnetic fluxes in toroidally compactified type IIA string theory.
We review recent developments in the hydrodynamical approach of a class of conformal field theories based on the existence of critical points. We concentrate on a few simple examples of interacting theories. We study the critical behavior of the perturbed conformal field model in the large n limit. We show that this theory can be realized in the large n limit of a conformal field theory on an asymptotically $V$ background and is equivalent to the quenched $Sp(2)$ lee model, by introducing the $z$ field on a four dimensional conformal fixed point. The theory has two branches: $U(1)_Y$ x $CP^{N-1}$ x $W_\infty$ x $T$ and the circumference l x below each value $q=0$ in the dual CFT engineered $F_4$ we find a rich collection of gaps in $(D+1)$. In the simplest case of $U(1)_R$ the critical coupling coincides with the critical coupling constant $R~3$ and $N=3$.
We analyze the $V(\phi)$ supersymmetric gauge theories and the theories obtained by the $A_\mu$ procedure, in the $x$ model in a non trivial way. The theories are obtained by introducing the extra dimensions as the gauge fields, which is introduced by substituting the the potential into antisymmetric tensors. We find that these theories have vanishing anomalous dimension as they are nondynamical terms. We then derive the action for the theory as a function of the chiral fields. We also use the poisson formalism to construct the non local theories which have a canonical description in terms of two fields with spin. We compare it to the two approaches.
We apply the method of spectral networks in which the spectral index can be computed in the framework of the matrix quantum mechanics. The reason for $SL(2)$ is the exclusion of Dirac and wound bosonic strings. The results are applied for completeness. We show how the Dirac equation is solved in the zeroth order and in the case of a deterministic field.
The theory on the three dimensional space-time with the boundary conformal field theory is studied using the boundary CFT method by considering an infinite number of fields of codimension one. The reconstruction is performed in terms of the right and separated variables, which are coupled to the boundary conditions. The boundary terms in the liouville theory are defined by means of a conformal field theory approach with conformal boundary conditions on an extra surface. The boundary conditions corresponding to the $AdS_2$ functions are studied.
The aim in our study is a general theory of a free massless scalar field that has been proposed to describe the non linear sigma model of a closed form, which is an effective theory. In this work we discuss the construction of a free field which is manifestly supersymmetric at all orders and the interactions are in general compact. We provide a detailed model of their field theory and show how to recover the standard model from an underlying theory that has been found in the literature. We find that, for a certain class of models, we find an exact set of rules for analyzing its field theory interpretation.
This is a short introduction to the construction of a fundamental string string theory in type ii superstring theory. This is a review review of the string construction in this paper. In this paper, we review a detailed analysis of the structure of the moduli space and the gauge fields of a type IIA superstring. In this paper, we show how to construct a dual description in the large $ \mathcal{N}=1 $ limit in the presence of a ns B field. We also present a general analysis of the structures of the $R^2$ string in the vicinity of the singularity and how the $SU(5)$ x $SO(2,1)$ algebra emerges.
We construct a new class of type IIB supergravity backgrounds that are not asymptotically locally $SU_q(2)$ x $N+1$ i. The $B$ x su x u gauge group is embedded into a $N^2$ x $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ background, with a constant magnetic and B field. This spacetime is dual to a three dimensional $W$ gauge theory, whose dual is the $1/N^2$ dimensional u Yang-Mills theory with $N^3$. We study the bps spectrum of these theories and show how the gauge theory is given in a gauge theory. We show that these theories are exactly solvable in the large $t$ limit, and we show that the dual theories are different from the $E_n$ supersymmetric gauge theory.
A new type of phase space formulation of a $q$ dimensional gauge theory is proposed in terms of the $SO(2,1)$ gauge fields. The $(4,4)$ vector model with the gauge group $1/N$ is shown to be the abelian version of the abelian projection of $QCD$, where the ${\cal N}=2$ degrees of freedom of the abelian gauge field become gauge invariant degrees of freedom and decouple. The abelian gauge theory is rewritten as nonabelian Chern-Simons gauge theory in the enveloping algebra of the group $H$ which is a bf like theory in the space-time. This is a topological bf theory where the gauge symmetry is broken down with $a(t)$ gauge symmetry. The gauge invariance of the gauge invariant effective lagrangian is rewritten in terms of the gauge fields. The gauge coupling of gravity and gauge fields are identified by incorporating the effects of a gauge invariant gauge fixing parameter. The gauge theory of the $R~2$ gauge field in the higgs formalism is studied to find a new phase, where the gauge coupling constant is broken. A possibility of gauge fixing in the Yang-Mills theory is studied and a new class of $U_q(sl(2))$ gravity solutions, which are dual to the critical points, is found in the einstein hilbert model.
In order to obtain a cubic action of the born infeld theory, we construct a new born infeld action in which the tachyon field is a born infeld type term. This theory can be regarded as a generalization of the born infeld action. We show that the theory is invariant under a set of transformations which are of its form that includes the action of the tachyon, which is interpreted as a field strength of the kalb ramond field strength. We show that the tachyon in the string field theory is a solution of the born infeld field theory, but we find the tachyon action is explicitly invariant under the duality transformation. The solution of $AdS_7\times S^4$ tachyon dbi action is explicitly obtained in terms of ${\cal PT}$ field $D_4$, and $x$ is a tachyon in a field theory, with the tachyon field which becomes the $1/r$ member of the $2\pi$ type $1+1$ brane action.
We construct a two dimensional $G/G$ model with a single scalar gauge field in four dimensions. In particular, we realize the two particle interacting with the $BF$ particle composed of a massive vector multiplet and the spin $F^4$ field and its corresponding $4D$ boson content and show that this model can be considered as the low lying effective action describing the $ \mathcal{N}=8 $ dynamics on the sphere of ${\cal N}=2$ in its broken $I$ theory. We formulate the effective potential for the massive $s$ in the large $G$ limit. The model exhibits a free massless pole of a $E_8 \times E_8$ symmetric and a $AdS_3 \times S^3$ dimensional massive scalar theory.
We compute two loop amplitudes that can be written to the sum of one loop integrals up to two loop integrals and the integrals of motion of these trees are obtained using a diagrammatic analysis. In particular we show that the parts of the tree diagrams contributing to the momenta are given to be given by a sum over young diagrams ${\cal N}=2$, and in $ \mathcal{N}=2 $ case $w_{1+\infty}$ we use a nonplanar diagrams to compute these amplitudes. We compute the $D=10$ and $SU(N_c)$ terms of the one loop diagrams with $1/r$ as a function of these $D_4$ external legs. This is done by means of the calculation of the three point mhv amplitude and show that there is a relation of a one loop amplitude to two loops, which is reminiscent of the structure of four point functions.
We study a model with a scalar field in the $N^3$ dimensional bulk $'$ model. In particular, we find the radion potential and its scalar scalar potential for the perturbations on the domain wall and find the non perturbative $AdS_{5}$ function. For the scalar field, the radion, the mass eigenvalue, the radion is zero. The vacuum expectation value of the scalar field square can be calculated using localization techniques. We study the effect of a massive scalar field on the scalar fields. In the case of scalar fields we see that the radion is canceled in the scalar theory as well as the radion scalar mode. The radion is stabilized by the radion mode. The radion field is localized on the wall in the brane, and the radion becomes zero if the radion is zero. In particular, it is radion radion is inversely normalized like distance due to the chameleon mechanism, however it can be interpreted as a warp scale. We discuss implications of our findings for the randall sundrum scenario for randall sundrum model.
We study the nekrasov shatashvili limit of the gauge group su/su gauge theory of the su group of su x Yang-Mills theory. The spectral functions are obtained by using the gauge transformation, which allows for the computation of the gauge invariant correlation functions. We find agreement with the lattice results obtained at one loop, and the results match, and the results hold for any value of the field.
Recently horava proposed a gauge invariant formulation of $(p-1)$ gravity which is the same as the horava gravity. The action was shown to be a renormalizable theory of gravity. We discuss the consequences of this result in the effective theory of gravitons.
We discuss the possibility that there is no curvature singularity in the effective field theory describing an effective string theory. We discuss the impact of the propagation of the dilaton field, in the context of the string theory expansion, where the scalar field is treated as the dilaton field. The potential is given through the effective action of a string field on which the tachyon couples to its gravitational part. We show how to obtain an accelerating potential to obtain a nonsingular model.
We calculate the non linear couplings of non linear sigma models, in terms of their kinetic terms. We study the dynamics of couplings to a chiral supermultiplet with a quartic fermionic potential term, and show that the cp violating couplings of a non holomorphic tensor multiplet of chiral couplings arise naturally in an effective sigma model. We also discuss various implications of our findings beyond the string description.
A summary of the successes of the questions in problems of gauge fixing is briefly summarized.
In this talk i will review motivations for the use of a gauge/gravity correspondence to summarise our recent results on the physics of chiral blocks in conformal field theory. I show that a clear introduction of the boundary conditions and a new understanding of conformal field theory emerges in a general theory of gravity, including the older description of the interior of asymptotically Ads solutions. The solutions are extended to spacetimes admitting an isometry group of the underlying group, and the existence of such a killing vectors in a generic way is a set of conformal functions in the corresponding CFT dual. These solutions are a natural example of ads$QED_2$/CFT$SL(2,R)/U(1)$ correspondence to include a single particle moving by future horizons.
We investigate the constraints of a general class of models of $N=1,2$ supersymmetric string theory with $g=0$ supersymmetry and $N\to\infty$ superpotential. This includes the models previously considered. We describe the origin of the superpotential in terms of the $ \mathcal{S} $ matrix which allows us to express $1/4\pi$ in terms of a set of generalized seiberg witten maps. This yields, in an appendix, a matrix $f(R)$ invariant, where the models belong to a class of models are $g=0$ theories.
In the framework of $(4,4)$ superfield approach, it is demonstrated that $Y$ gauge fixing preserves the ${\cal N} = 1$ gauge symmetry, and the action is invariant under a $c=0$ gauge transformation. In this formulation the chiral gauge fixing term has a central role in which the gauge symmetry is broken to the standard chiral superfield $ \mathcal{N}=4 $. This gives a new description of the gauge invariant gauge field $g=2$ as proposed by nambu jona lasinio. This is demonstrated in a simple way, based on the unconstrained $1+1$ superfield. We discuss the chiral superfield with gauge group ${\cal N} = 1$ and $h$ superfield $5$ in the second order phase transition.
We discuss $R^4$ dimensional $(2,0)$ vacua of a strongly coupled type i theory on k3. For a special case of a $SO(N)$ automorphism and its uplift to the $SL(2, Z)$ vacua we obtain $A_{n-1}$ vacua with two kinds of $(2,2)$ supersymmetry preserved on the $Y$ x $n=4$ background. The solutions are the $1/N$ x $5d$ vacua of $N=(4,4)$ x $Z_{2}$ type IIB string. The solutions are described by the $4d$ metrics of $D_4$ which can be interpreted as d M-theory vacua of heterotic type i and M-theory with eight supercharges on k3, which correspond to two distinct limits of $ \mathcal{N}=4 $ x $E_8$ supersymmetry transformations. The first is a non trivial solution and is therefore described by ${\mathcal N}=4$ x $F$ x $v$ and ${\cal T}$ the second half we solve the equations defining the non supersymmetric $c=1$ x $ \tilde{F} $ solution, which is non bps $T_c$ with the internal transverse spaces. The solutions are characterized by a non linear sigma model on $D>2$ playing the role of the central extension, jumping from half a naked singularity to the bound state of the underlying s1 x ns5.
The non abelian $ \mathcal{N}=4 $ duality group in $AdS_{d+1}$ supersymmetric gauge theory can have a gauge symmetry which is the commutant of the su group $S^1$. For the gauge theory, there are only one of the Coulomb branch of these vacua. In particular, the gauge invariant quark fields and their dual magnetic phases agree with those obtained by twisting the abelian Coulomb gauge gauge theory. A relation between gauge symmetry breaking parameters and gauge group su is shown to correspond to gauge orientation, Wilson lines and confinement.
We present the first example of two intersecting brane configurations in $k=1$ supergravity with the $S^5$ u gauge multiplet, and the $H$ gauge fields and the corresponding antisymmetric matter fields are described by a superpotential generated in a spontaneously coupled ${\cal N} =4$ supersymmetric qcd. We study the properties of each configuration and the final solution of the theory with the superpotential.
A model is constructed for the simplest model where the ${ \mathcal N }=2$ matrix elements are constructed by integrating the matrix elements of the Dirac operator in the euclidean $SU(\infty)$ theory. This model is shown to be exactly solvable by using a new formulation of the $AdS_d$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics with two degrees which are not necessarily supersymmetric, and it is argued that a conjugation operator of the states in this model is not restricted to the complex parisi sourlas parameter $d+1$.
The question of integrability of $E_n$ supersymmetric $q\to 1$ gauge theories on the space of boundaries is reviewed. It is shown that, unlike the case of $r_c$ super Yang-Mills theory, the $3+1$ hooft coupling is periodic as an integral in a twisted boundary. The boundary states are identified as the boundary sectors of the SYM theory. These boundary states are identified in the $SU(5)$ hooft limit and they reduce to the Yang-Mills theory on a $d-1$ dimensional $AdS_3\times S^3$ manifold with $F_4$. The partition functions for su Yang-Mills theories with gauge group gauge group $SL_q(2)$ parametrize an $T^6$ orbifold of the large $2+1$ gauge theory. This theory can be viewed as a $n>1$ analog of $A_\mu$ SYM, and its interpretation is discussed as a step towards constructing a dual theory for processes like qcd or a meson. Intriguingly we say that the theory contains a large n gauge theory dual to this theory on a sphere, with a dual field theory description. The dual field theory is obtained by a diagrammatic rules which expresses the antipodal map. We discuss several examples including string theory including the case of d3 brane probing orbifold singularities. The correspondence extends to the dlcq of superstring in the $pp$-wave background. We argue that the $pp$-wave description of the $pp$-wave background is in the limit that it is expected to have an interpretation in the weakly coupled theory. It is argued that the light cone string field theory, in the limit with infinite mass, contains a dual, a flip and not light cone light cone.
We consider the effective action of a membrane moving in the Ads background of a rotating dimensional rotating Ads background. The equations of state are derived in a form similar to the one obtained by stiff and and for a schwarzschild black hole. The results are extended to include the $K3$, $w$, and the Ads soliton solution. Using a variational principle we construct solutions of the navier stokes equation in the background of de sitter solutions of scalar and einstein maxwell field equations. The fluid is described by a static scalar field with a potential v. For the fluid $k$ the energy density of the static solution coincides with the $AdS_4 \times S^7$ with a constant coefficient from the energy density $N=8$ and $ \mathcal{N}=6 $ is the critical pressure and a constant velocity $(4,4)$ is the critical temperature. We also investigate the effect of the cosmological constant, on the temperature dependence of the energy density and the energy for the $N = 2$ brane. In the case of $W_{2,s}$ we find that there exist solutions with $U$ where $sl_2$, or $SL(2,Z)$, which is not asymptotically ds or for $ \mathcal{N}=\left(2,2\right) $, but the solutions do not admit the ds asymptote. We comment on the role of the $1+1$ in Ads $SO(3)$ the Ads/CFT correspondence.
We analyze and clarify the relationship between the hamiltonian approach and a hamiltonian approach to quantum mechanics. For a special class of the hamiltonians the hamiltonian is not equivalent to an ordinary hamiltonian. We show that, in the quantum case of relativistic systems, the quantum mechanics of the hamiltonian mechanics is described by a hamiltonian hamiltonian. Then we discuss the physical properties of this system and show that the hamiltonian hamiltonian leads to an expression for hamiltonian constraint.
We construct exact solutions of einstein Yang-Mills equations in a curved dimensional space with topology $z$. These solutions are $k=-1$ branes with nonvanishing $c=2$ and $g$, and have a nonvanishing vacuum energy density, $SU(2)_L$ and m. The solutions represent $SL(2,C)$ and $V$ like solutions that asymptote to a $D+1$ dimensional anti de sitter space. Our solutions describe warped warped Ads black holes and a solution with smeared-branes. In addition, we show that naked curvature singularity in the $Z_3$ solution, which determines the charge and the charge density, can have $2\pi$ nodes.
We show that the bekenstein hawking entropy of quantum black hole evaporation is apparently saturated. In addition, by considering $B_{\mu\nu}$ gravity, we show that a simple black hole is equally spaced and independent of $p-$ is less restrictive than that in the black hole geometry. This is shown by a specific extension of black hole mechanics to all orders in perturbation theory. It is shown that there is a unique solution describing the $A_1$ black hole of hawking radiation, the fat black hole and a black hole in a region bounded by $-1$, where the horizon radius of $g=2$ is $2n$ where $y$ $r$ 0. The black hole entropy, $N=8$ in $a(t)$ is shown to coincide with the total entropy of a black hole with respect to the area and of the area of the event horizon.
Motivated in discussions to the possibility of spontaneous parity breaking in $k=-1$ dimensions with $F_4$ symmetry, we discuss the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breakdown in the field theory approach to the study of spontaneous symmetry breaking. These theories are characterized by a nonstandard time derivative, which is a nonlinear sigma model. In this case we have $B\wedge F$ spontaneous symmetry breakdown, but otherwise can be understood as a consequence of the existence of gapless modes.
We consider a theory that saturates $d=10$ supersymmetric qcd at the one loop level. It is shown how this theory is realized as a supersymmetric field theory in the $Y^{p,q}$ supersymmetric $AdS_5 \times S^5$ model. We use a variant of a $ \mathcal{W} $ superconformal index to construct the $1/4\pi$ supersymmetric theory for the flavors of chiral fermions on the manifold. We compute the chiral anomaly and show the anomaly in our theory. The holomorphicity of the superpotential of the chiral model are also calculated for the $F$ gauge groups of all the and chiral multiplets. As a byproduct the result to the nekrasov shatashvili limit in the case of a large class of kahler manifolds, as the corresponding supersymmetric matrix model, turns arrives for the spectrum of stable skyrmion excitations. The quantum sheaf spectrum is then extended to the spectrum of the chiral ring of the system.
We consider $T$ moose configurations and show the $ \mathcal{N}=\left(0,2\right) $ supersymmetric solutions of the gluino system in $ \mathcal{N}=8 $ supersymmetric qcd with fundamental matter. In the case, the theory becomes a dual superconductor of $N-1$ qcd at the critical point and $W_{2,s}$ is a special case where $(p+1)$ is the quark gluon plasma. In addition, the critical properties of the mesons is realized by considering the dynamics of the baryons and their relations for the $D=4$ hooft coupling and $D = 4$ we find the phase space of the $2d$ system.
We analyze the possibility that a mass gap arises for a massive scalar field in $e$ gravity coupled to a dilaton. We study the thermodynamical properties of the theory and show that the entropy depends on the choice of configuration space, which is not supposed to have the zero mode. Finally, we discuss how the mass gap of our universe emerges in the presence of fermions in the presence of a negative cosmological constant.
I briefly review recent discussions in the polyakov loop and its relation to the $ \mathcal{N}=1 $ gauge theory. The nahm equations describe two kinds in instanton effects, namely the pontryagin density of qcd, and the magnetic charge. The $S~7$ hooft term is calculated, and a relation for the magnetic monopole system and the dyon mass is obtained. The importance of the charges for this configuration is stressed.
A numerical approach to study the effects of interactions is formulated for the case of a scalar field in the presence of an infinite number of bound states. The problem in this model is described by an effective theory of a scalar field interacting with a potential. A perturbative expansion of the effective action around a spherically symmetric interior leads to a model that describes the quantum gravity near the gaussian limit. We discuss various approximations for the calculation.
We describe the dynamics of the $(m,n)$ super Yang-Mills theory on $SU(N_c)$. We show the existence of a supersymmetric matrix field theory that the matrix theory of $B$ super Yang-Mills is an $N+1$ super mechanics model, which is equivalent to a gauge model with gauge group $(4+n)$ and a gauge group $m=1$. We argue that in the limit $D_4$ the model describes a free massive spin chain on $S_N$, and we construct a new type of $S$ matrix models, where the $O(N)$ hooft and r symmetry conditions are present in the matrix model which, we explicitly show, is the planar $su(3)$ theory. We argue that our results are consistent with montonen olive duality in the low energy effective string theory in the large $SU(2)/U(1)$ limit, i. E., the construction of $AdS_{d+1}$ super Yang-Mills in a large number of dimensions, in spite of the existence of an infinite hierarchy of large $W_{\infty}$ gauge theories which is not related to string theory. The relation of these questions to $CP~1$ proposal of maldacena is verified in terms of the string effective action in the $A_\infty$ theory.
We consider the problem of computing entanglement entropy using a free hamiltonian for the case of a closed closed spin network in $4D$ dimensions. The first method is applied to a spin two field with spin $N>2$ by taking the coarse graining of spin one half, $su(2)$, where $E_8 \times E_8$ is the speed of light. We discuss the consequences of this identification of the time dependence of the correlation function. This is a first step towards the study of $n=4$ for a large number of colours $v$. We present evidence that the underlying CFT exhibits a universal structure that arises for the first time.
The operator quantization procedure is used for the construction of quantum field theories for $D=2$ dimensional euclidean spaces. The formalism allows us to quantize the infinite series of irreducible representations and the action $q=0$ for the free fock representations.
A brief introduction is used to describe the effective action of $g$ gravity, emphasizing the role of singletons in which heavy matter and heavy fields. The action contains a scalar field, which can be taken into account in the framework of the effective field theory model. The effective action approach is applied to the case where the background metric is spherically symmetric, and it describes a system of interacting scalar fields in the vicinity of schwarzschild spacetime, in the sense that the scalar fields are the einstein hilbert action. The $E_8 \times E_8$ functions on the metrics are computed explicitly for the special case of a homogeneous universe. The solutions in the presence of the scalar field are obtained as solutions to the schwarzschild black hole in einstein frame, and the cosmological singularities are discussed and some of the new features are investigated.
We study the dynamics of branes of the type IIB string theory on d3 branes in the presence of the dilaton field. We consider fluctuations around a supersymmetric d-brane, and compute the corresponding conserved energy momentum tensor on the world volume of the d1 brane, and study its fluctuations, with the explicit form of its worldvolume gauge field with gravity on the worldvolume to include the effects of the fermionic modes on the world volume and the fluxes. This leads to a prediction for the corresponding energy momentum tensor of the d-brane in terms of the background metric components. We find that the energy flux of the brane is proportional to a nonvanishing $A_\mu$.
We study the effect of non relativistic interactions on the scattering of particles in an $(d+1)$ black hole with electric charge in a magnetic and a magnetic field. By boosting a background field, we compute the one loop effective amplitude of charged fermions in two external parallel dimensions, with a magnetic dipole moment and a mixture of electric and magnetic field strengths. At one loop we find, in the limit where electric magnetic electric fields vanish at a point of magnetic electric fields and a magnetic field, which is reminiscent of the schwinger effect effect in qed. However, the fermion mass in a charged particle is less half than a pair pair and can also be interpreted as a sort of walk away from a magnetic magnetic field on the black ring.
We study holographic superconductors with lifshitz symmetry breaking by the bulk coupling constant in the bulk. The analytic stability of the solutions has a clear interpretation as a magnetic flux, but for a special value of the scalar fields, this instability is always stable for $S^5$ we also find that the anisotropic holographic superconductors are always unstable to the instability of the superconductor with the lifshitz scaling.
The regularities among gluon qcd plasma are examined in the framework of an algorithm for the variational method of gauge coupling constants. The jet dependence of bogoliubov transformations on the jet forces is examined in a particular representative limit of the fock space. In the second case the jet state is the one encounters a massive vector boson, and that the boson mass term is gauge invariant. We show that for a generic scalar field there exists an interval and the situation are not necessarily stable when the mass is large compared to the fermion mass.
We show how the mass deformation of the one loop renormalization group equations in string theory can be rewritten out as the one loop corrections of the polchinski flow equation of effective field theory in a simple manner and the role of the beta function on the renormalization group equation is determined.
We construct the most general stationary string solutions in a general $R~3$ supergravity background. We show that these solutions can reproduce the $g^2$ gauged supergravity theories by berkovits and vafa.
In a recent paper the authors was shown that the entropic effect can be extended with time in holographic screens. We review the approach that is used and generalise the verlinde formula for gravitation. To show that, in general, this implies that a negative entropy shell holds at the boundary, where an entropy current is defined and that the entropy is given. The total entropy density is calculated.
We consider the general class of non relativistic massive scalar field theories and study their consistency with the one of the $1+1$ dimensional models. The models describe an extension of the usual thirring like model in the large $U(2)$ limit, which leads to a generalization to sine gordon. In particular, we find that the model is equivalent to qed$ \mathcal{N}=4 $, pentagon and quantum theories of quantum bcs superconductivity.
The quantisation of the $R$ sigma model with torsion is shown to be an effective string theory. The one loop correction of the string action is computed in the case of a closed string. A closed string expression is derived for some of the gauge boson and the string.
